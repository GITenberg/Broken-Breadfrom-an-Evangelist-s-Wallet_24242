<p>This is a book made up of fragments.&nbsp; The Master once
said &ldquo;Gather up the fragments that nothing be
lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be that victuals will be found here
that may feed those who cannot sit down to a meal.&nbsp; Many of
the articles have appeared in <i>Joyful News</i> already, but,
perhaps, are none the worse for that.&nbsp; We send out this
little book in the hope that both crust and crumb will be
eaten!</p>

1</span>I.&nbsp; SPIRITUAL FARMING.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">No.</span> 1.<br />
DRAINING.</h2>
<p>If the men who farmed England in the olden time could return,
few things would surprise them more than the condition of the
land.&nbsp; Many a field now bearing good crops each year, was in
&ldquo;the good old times&rdquo; moorland or fen.&nbsp; Sheep and
cattle graze where once only wild birds could live.&nbsp;
Drainage has made the change.&nbsp; The land, once too cold and
wet to allow anything valuable to grow, has been by grips and
drain pipes, made to produce food for man and beast.</p>
<p>Is it not so on God&rsquo;s farm?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are His
husbandry,&rdquo; and just as the farmer knows that if he cannot
have his wet land drained, his seed will be starved, or the young
corn perish with the cold, so we who toil in the Lord&rsquo;s
fields need to learn that in many places the first thing to be
done is to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Drain the
Land</span>.</p>
<p>Do any of our readers complain that they cannot get an answer
to their prayers for a revival, and that all the preaching and
teaching seem to be wasted?&nbsp; Let us advise them to look
under the surface.&nbsp; Are there not</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Causes for the
Failure</span>?</p>
<p>Would it not be well to try what draining the land would
do?&nbsp; Are the most influential men cold and unresponsive to
the call of the Spirit?&nbsp; What sort of people take the lead
in the prayer meetings?&nbsp; Are they left to the zealous
poor?&nbsp; <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Does every man of wealth and culture
hurry home and leave the preacher to shift for himself?&nbsp; Who
are the stewards?&nbsp; Are they men who will do their utmost to
welcome strangers, or does their example tell on others so much
that a visitor never has a word of welcome or a grip of the
hand?&nbsp; What is the singing like?&nbsp; Is it of the
colourless, tame style, whose only sign of life is the rapid
gallop which kills devotion in so many places?</p>
<p>How is the Bible read by the preacher?&nbsp; Does he confine
himself to the narrow round which he has read so often in the
ears of the people that it has lost its charm&mdash;or does he
seek out that which will be sure to interest; and does he read as
if he believed it?</p>
<p>We think our readers know some congregations in which there
can be no revival until the drainer has been at work, and that
which starves the seed removed.&nbsp; What we want is to have the
question asked at the next leader&rsquo;s or quarterly
meeting.</p>

3</span>II.&nbsp; LITTLE MOSES.<br />
SERVE THE CHILDREN FIRST.</h2>
<p>The story of Moses teaches us that <span class="smcap">little
folks are very helpless</span>.&nbsp; There he is in that
basket.&nbsp; He cannot care for himself.&nbsp; He is in the
power of the king&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; If she liked she could
have had him killed, for it was plain to be seen that he was one
of the Hebrew children.&nbsp; When you were in your cradle how
weak you were, how helpless.&nbsp; If your mother had not cared
for you, my dear boy, you would never have troubled the tailor to
measure you for your new suit.&nbsp; Do you ever think how much
you are in your mother&rsquo;s debt?&nbsp; When you were hungry
she fed you, when you were cold she warmed you, when you were
sick she nursed you.&nbsp; And you can pay her back.&nbsp; Not in
money, for when you are old enough to earn gold you will not be
rich enough to do that; but you can reward her by obedience, by
love, and by letting her know by your kindness that you do not
forget what she did for you years ago.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Little Folks are watched by
God</span>.&nbsp; The crocodiles could have swallowed up the
little chap at one mouthful, but they never even saw him.&nbsp;
God steered the little bark, and brought its voyage to an end in
a safe harbour.&nbsp; If anyone but the kind-hearted lady who
became his second mother had seen him, the story of his life
might have been very short.&nbsp; And the same God watches you,
my dear child.</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>There is an Eye which never sleeps; and in the night,
when even your mother has closed her eyes, God does not shut
His.&nbsp; Do you ever think that in the darkness the eye of God
can see you just as well as in the daylight?&nbsp; If it had not
been so, you would not have grown in your sleep, as you have done
every night.&nbsp; There have been many dangers near to you which
you never knew, but God did, and has watched over you for good
all your life.&nbsp; Thank Him, for even your mother could not
have helped you, if God had not done so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Little folks may become great
men</span>.&nbsp; That baby became one of the greatest men in Old
Testament history.&nbsp; And how was it?&nbsp; He stuck to his
book.&nbsp; We read that &ldquo;Moses was learned in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians.&rdquo;&nbsp; This could not have been if
he had scamped his lessons, could it?&nbsp; Then he left the
company of the wicked, though it cost him a great deal, and he
chose to be one of the people of God.&nbsp; The boy and girl who
will follow his example will do well for themselves, for the life
of Moses was one of the greatest honour, and, though he had to
pay the price which must be paid if we would win the smile of
God, he has been rewarded.&nbsp; Honour has come to him that
never came to anyone else; for we learn from the Book of
Revelation that in heaven his name is greatest of the great, for
the saints sing &ldquo;The song of Moses, the servant of
God,&rdquo; and</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Song of the
Lamb</span>.</p>

5</span>III.&nbsp; SPIRITUAL FARMING.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">No.</span> 2.<br />
PLOUGHING.</h2>
<p>There have been during the last few years great improvements
in the construction of the plough, but no one dreams of any
substitute for it.&nbsp; Ploughing is as necessary as sowing;
that is to say, the land must be stirred and prepared for the
seed.&nbsp; In heavenly husbandry there are some well-meaning
folk who would dispense with the plough, and preach faith without
repentance, but only to find that the birds of the air get most
of the seed!&nbsp; If there is to be an abiding work there must
be conviction of sin, and knowledge of guilt, and for this end
there is nothing better than a plough, made of Sinai steel and
wood grown on Calvary.</p>
<p>There are some directions given in the Old Book which it will
pay our ploughmen to study.&nbsp; One is as to the choice of the
team.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t yoke an ass with an ox (see Deut. xxii,
10).&nbsp; In your motive power see to it there is no mixture of
vanity with duty.&nbsp; You will not succeed in concealing the
fact.&nbsp; A donkey is one of the worst of animals to
hide.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">It will talk</span>!</p>
<p>Let there be no stopping at home because the wind is in the
east.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sluggard will not plough by reason of the
cold.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the ploughman means to succeed he must
count on suffering; and if the devil cannot find anyone on his
side to oppose, he will raise up some imbecile Christian to <!--
page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>do
so, who by some sneer or cold criticism, will try to keep the
plough idle.&nbsp; Instead of looking which way the wind blows,
get to work.</p>
<p>There must be no looking back.&nbsp; Mark the Master&rsquo;s
words in Luke ix, 62.&nbsp; Keep your eye on the mark, just as
the ploughman looks at the staff he has fixed as his guide.&nbsp;
Keep looking unto Jesus.&nbsp; Many a preacher, who could make
hell tremble for its own, has, by looking back, become
respectably commonplace.&nbsp; So the fine promise of his youth
dies ignobly, and is laid in the grave of Demas!&nbsp; Whether it
be a bag of gold, or a fair face, or a pillow of down, thou art
called to look back upon, do as the Master did&mdash;set thy
&ldquo;face toward Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keep a good heart on it.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that ploweth should
plow in hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; What is called success does not mean
reaping only.&nbsp; The plough is as honourable as the sickle,
though they may not make a feast, or dress thy team with
flowers!&nbsp; Whistle at the plough, and in time thou shalt be
bidden to the harvest supper.&nbsp; John Baptist was a ploughman,
and that was all; yet there are some reapers who would gladly
exchange places with him, badly paid as he was.&nbsp; In these
days too often the honour is paid to the successful evangelist,
and those who ploughed and sowed are forgotten; but the time is
coming when the promise shall be fulfilled&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The
ploughman shall overtake the reaper</span>.&rdquo;</p>

7</span>IV.&nbsp; A SHORT HOME MISSION SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>The Iron did
swim</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;2<span class="smcap">nd</span> <span
class="smcap">Kings</span>, vi, 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Did
It</span>?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Then Sunken Things May
Rise</span>.</p>
<p>The axe had fallen into the river, to the great sorrow of the
man who had used it.&nbsp; He was an honest man, for he mourned
over the fact that it was borrowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has sunk to
rise no more;&rdquo; and yet it swam!&nbsp; Why lose hope of the
fallen and degraded?&nbsp; They are no lower down than the axe
head was when at the bottom of the Jordan.&nbsp; &ldquo;The iron
did swim.&rdquo;&nbsp; How? for</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">SUNKEN THINGS
DO NOT RAISE THEMSELVES</span>.</p>
<p>If the axe had been let alone, it might have been at the
bottom of the river now.&nbsp; The man who felt its loss called
on a higher power than his own.&nbsp; He told his sorrow to one
who had sympathy for him.&nbsp; Do we cry unto God about those
who have sunk out of our reach?&nbsp; The lapsed masses, as we
call them, were not all born so.&nbsp; Many of them have been
Sunday scholars, and some of them church members.&nbsp; How do we
feel about them?&nbsp; Does the thought of their degradation ever
bring an &ldquo;alas!&rdquo; from our hearts?&nbsp;
Elisha&rsquo;s God is nearer to us than the prophet was to the
man who lost the axe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call on Him <span
class="smcap">while</span> He is near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The iron did swim.&rdquo;&nbsp; How was it done?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Somebody showed
it the way</span>.</p>
<p>An example was put before it.&nbsp; A stick was thrown in, and
the iron imitated it.&nbsp; O, the power of a godly
example!&nbsp; <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Let us who work among the ungodly show
them the way to live.&nbsp; Let the churches move over the places
where the degraded lie.&nbsp; We shall never lift them while we
remain in our beautiful churches and chapels.&nbsp; Only this
week we saw the iron made to swim, by the personal contact of
ministers and well-dressed people taking hold of the street folk,
and cheerily inviting them into God&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; A man
may be only &ldquo;a stick&rdquo; when in the pulpit; but in
hearty personal dealing with the degraded, he may be one who can
make the iron to swim.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<h3>&ldquo;LIVE IT.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A good man, the other day, was advising Ministers to preach
more on the doctrine of &ldquo;Entire
Sanctification.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of them replied,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Let us
live it</span>, <span class="smcap">that is the best way to
preach it</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps both were right; one thing is certain, that the way to
make the doctrine more popular is, to have more of those who
believe it to &ldquo;live it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We might greatly
increase the number of preachers, for every Christian might
preach.&nbsp; Women as well as men, we might preach every day,
for every duty would be a pulpit, and every trial an
oration.&nbsp; No one would complain the sermons were too long;
for all people are willing that you should never cease to do them
good.&nbsp; What say you reader!&nbsp; Will you enter the ranks
of this Ministry?</p>

9</span>V.&nbsp; THE BATTLE OF THE BEANFIELD.<br />
2 <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>, xxiii, 11, 12.</h2>
<p>What a picture is here!&nbsp; A field of ripe beans, just
ready for the harvest, and then the leaves and pods all
blood-stained or trampled down!&nbsp; Those Philistines liked to
fight rather than to work, preferring plunder to ploughing, so
they would cross the border and carry away the results of the
farmer&rsquo;s toil.&nbsp; But they made a mistake in coming
where Shammah lived!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">He
Stood</span>!</p>
<p>Have not many of us to complain that the enemies of
God&rsquo;s people still like to plunder our harvest
fields?&nbsp; How Satan grasps at our elder scholars!&nbsp; He is
not content with gutter-children.&nbsp; He likes to take our
young men and women, and so we hear drunken men quote scripture,
and bloated women hum psalm tunes!</p>
<p>What shall we do?&nbsp; We read, &ldquo;The people fled from
the Philistines.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shall we leave the results of our
Sunday school work in the hands of the enemy?&nbsp; Is it not
time that we made a stand?&nbsp; The thing is becoming
monotonous, so much so, that in some places it is thought not
worth being grieved about, that the young men and women, who have
passed through our schools, never attend the chapel, and are lost
to us for years, if not for ever!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Soldiers of Christ arise!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a lad enlists, and is sent to Aldershot, we soon put the
chaplain on his track, and shall we not do something for those
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>who are carried away by those sons of Anak which we call
the theatre and racecourse?&nbsp; Would it not pay us to have a
holy band of men and women to hunt up our lapsed scholars, and to
fight for the harvest we sowed and have waited for so long, only
to see it carried away by the Philistines?</p>
<p>In all our large towns there are neighbourhoods where the
enemy of God and man is strongly entrenched.&nbsp; And yet there
are churches and chapels in those streets.&nbsp; The few who
attend those places pass houses, once respectable, but now given
up to vice.&nbsp; Homes where there was once family worship, are
now, to use the words of the Wise man, &ldquo;The way of hell,
going down to the chambers of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is to be done?&nbsp; &ldquo;There are not many members
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no one to work.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
it might have been said in the bean-field; the people were gone,
all gone but Shammah.&nbsp; He stood, and God showed, then, as
now, that He was prepared to stand by the minority, if it were
loyal to Him, for He wrought a great, not an ordinary one, but a
great victory!</p>
<p>There are yet great victories to be won when we turn on our
pursuers.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be carried away by bad example.&nbsp;
We go with a multitude to do evil, when we refuse to fight for
the results of past work done by ourselves or our fathers.&nbsp;
Shammah seems to have said, &ldquo;If I am to die, I will die
here among the beans.&nbsp; Better so than pine to death for want
of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not true that with the harvest of our
toil they carry away our faith in God, and in His word?&nbsp;
Much of the Bible is lost to those who flee rather than
fight.&nbsp; A great deal of our hymn book is for</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Believers Fighting</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those battle songs cannot be enjoyed by men who never <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>leave the barracks.&nbsp; No wonder the old tunes are
not sung by craven hearts.&nbsp; Let those of us who have left
Shammah to fight alone, rejoin him, then we shall have the joy of
conquest, and the gladness of those who divide the spoil.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<h3>WAITING AND READY.</h3>
<p>The other day, looking out of a train, as we stopped at a
country station, I saw a row of buckets painted red, with the
word FIRE on each of them.&nbsp; There they were, waiting to be
used, if occasion required, and I noticed that each of them was
filled with water.&nbsp; Only a humble kind of agent is a bucket,
yet being full of water and near at hand, it is easy to see that
in the event of fire breaking out there, it is more than likely
it would be put out without doing much damage.</p>
<p>Are we,&mdash;Ministers, Local Preachers, Sunday School
Teachers, Class-leaders, and other workers&mdash;are we ready for
use?&nbsp; It is not enough that people can tell by our
appearance that we are separated for service&mdash;are we
ready?&nbsp; It did not suffice the man in charge of that little
station to have those buckets on the stand, and it is not enough
that we are in the pulpit or the class-room.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Are we
Filled</span>?</p>
<p>We can be filled with that which will put out the fire, and if
we are not full, who is there to blame but ourselves?&nbsp; Those
buckets might have been neglected till the hoops dropped off, and
the power to hold water was gone, all because they were not kept
full, and if so, they would be an apt illustration of some who
have ceased to be the men they were, and only that they fill the
same place, we should not dream of them being used at all.</p>

12</span>VI.&nbsp; &ldquo;HIS CHAINS FELL OFF.&rdquo;<br />
<span class="smcap">Acts</span> xii. 7.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In answer to Prayer</span>:&mdash;Do you
know any one tied and bound?&nbsp; Have you prayed for them
without ceasing?&nbsp; Are you conscious of the enemy putting
<span class="smcap">your</span> hands or feet in fetters?&nbsp;
Are you unable to reach that purse which was at one time always
within your grasp, so that now you do not give to the poor as you
once did?&nbsp; Are your feet prevented from going on errands of
mercy?&nbsp; Do the manacles keep you at home on Sundays, instead
of walking muddy lanes to preach?&nbsp; If so, how do you like
it?&nbsp; Do you not think you should cry to God?</p>
<p>We know a godly and cultivated minister who got into Doubting
Castle, some years ago.&nbsp; He was losing hold of God, and his
duty was becoming irksome, so he cried unto the Lord in his
trouble.&nbsp; &ldquo;I let them all go to bed,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and had an all-night of prayer,&rdquo; and his chains fell
off.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Very quietly</span>.&nbsp; Not a single
soldier was awakened.&nbsp; God can speak in loudest tones, as at
Phillippi.&nbsp; He can bring His people out without anyone
knowing, till they tell the tale themselves.&nbsp; It has often
been the case, that some gentle, quiet preacher has been the
instrument of deliverance to the Lord&rsquo;s chosen ones.&nbsp;
There has been a revolution in nature.&nbsp; What a blessed
change!&nbsp; How the chains of winter have fallen off, and that
surly east-wind jailer been dismissed without noise or
clamour.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>When free, Peter went to tell those who had prayed him
out.&nbsp; He found them in a state of great surprise.&nbsp; How
good of God not to limit our success in prayer by our faith, or
the want of it.&nbsp; In this also He does &ldquo;exceeding
abundantly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still they did not fail, depend on it,
to praise the Lord.&nbsp; Herod soon found it out, and was
abashed.&nbsp; He would not dare to meet a Christian in the
street, for the smile on the believer&rsquo;s face would say,
&ldquo;His chains fell off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do not let us who can
pray be ever discouraged.&nbsp; We can touch the heart of God, so
let us sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lion of Judah shall break every
chain,<br />
And give us the victory again and again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little did the lame man&rsquo;s friends think that this was

<span class="smcap">Mark</span> xi, 3.</h2>
<p>What! of an Ass?&nbsp; Yes, &ldquo;God hath chosen the foolish
things of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gets renown to Himself by
&ldquo;using things which are despised.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us never
despair of the most foolish of men, if he become the servant of
Jesus.&nbsp; It is said of the great John Hunt, that when a young
man, he gave no promise of the talents he shewed in the work of
the Ministry.&nbsp; We have spoken with one who knew him before
his conversion, who made us smile as he described his gait and
style of life.&nbsp; Yet this ungainly ploughboy became a man
whom to know was to admire.&nbsp; It was in Christ&rsquo;s hands,
though, he improved so greatly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Does the Lord really need an
Ass</span>?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The Scriptures foretold that Jesus
should come &ldquo;riding upon an ass.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not
beautiful to think of the poor despised Ass fulfilling so grand a
prophecy?&nbsp; &ldquo;The knowledge of the Lord shall cover the
earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may help that on.&nbsp; Will the young men
and women who read this bear in mind that no one ever used this
ass till Jesus did?&nbsp; Why should He not be the first to use
you?&nbsp; &ldquo;What!&rdquo; say you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
compare us to an ass?&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, if we do, the Bible is
before us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man be born like a wild ass&rsquo;s
colt.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, if you have not remembered the claims God
has upon you, the poor ass has the best of it, for the Lord says
&ldquo;The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his Master&rsquo;s
crib, but Israel doth not know, my people doth not
consider.&rdquo;&nbsp; Have you <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>noticed that
unconverted men and women are pictured in Exodus xiii. 13, where
you see a young ass with his neck broken?&nbsp; The Lord needs
you that He may redeem you from your fate, and that you may be
spared to bear his yoke.</p>
<p>Is not the best way to elevate men, to let the Lord have the
use of them?&nbsp; However coarse and mean we are by nature, He
can refine and elevate us.&nbsp; And any part of our life that is
in danger of baseness may be lifted to beauty and blessing by
putting it under the Christ.&nbsp; What a change came over this
animal in one short day!&nbsp; An ass in the morning, but the</p>

just what is promised.&nbsp; A revival in <span class="smcap">the

of preachers seems to be dull, and where there is a monotony
which would shame a prison.&nbsp; Yes, there, right there, look
out for the water, not stagnant, but water that &ldquo;breaks
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall the lame man leap as the
hart&rdquo; that finds the stream it needs, and the &ldquo;dumb
shall sing,&rdquo; for this living water shall quench his thirst,
and loosen his dried-up tongue.&nbsp; When shall it be?&nbsp;

19</span>X.&nbsp; SPIRITUAL FARMING.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">No.</span> 3.<br />
CULTIVATION.</h2>
<p>We have already called the attention of our readers to the
subject of ploughing, but we feel we have not pressed upon them
with the force it deserves, the necessity of what the Bible calls
&ldquo;breaking up the fallow ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; What the
plough and spade do for the land we must have done for the minds
of those who sit in Methodist pews.&nbsp; Unsaved men and women
must be compelled to look the truth in the face.&nbsp; Farmers
know that so long as the land is hard and cloddy, the seed has no
chance to get the nourishment by which it lives; besides by
turning it over, the plough exposes that which has been hidden to
the light of day, and it is by turning it up that it gets the
benefit of the atmosphere.&nbsp; The nitrogen contained in the
air is filled with that which the growing seed requires to find
in the land, if it is to do well for the worker.&nbsp; Have we
not thirty-fold crops where we ought to have hundredfold, for
want of better ploughs?&nbsp; The heathen who spoke of preaching
as &ldquo;turning the world upside down&rdquo; hit on the truth;
and those of us who fail to turn up the soil are not likely to
reap all we might do.&nbsp; The other day we heard an intelligent
man tell the story of his conversion.&nbsp; He was awakened under
the preaching of Mr. Robinson Watson.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I
never used to listen to sermons, I sat in the corner of the pew
and thought of business, or <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>any machine I
was planning, and did not hear a word, but Mr. Robinson compelled
me to think and act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does not this man represent many?&nbsp; Are these people to be
allowed to come and go, without, in some way or other, being
compelled to listen?&nbsp; Let every one of us, from the top to
the bottom of the Plan, say, God helping me, I will break up the
ground.&nbsp; Indifference shall become difficult.&nbsp; Some of
us can remember listening to men whom we feared when they opened
the hymn book, for if they began the service with one of the
hymns in &ldquo;Exhorting sinners to return to God,&rdquo; we
knew there would be difficulty in getting to sleep, either in the
pew then, or in bed, hours afterwards.&nbsp; Perhaps the greatest
want of the church to-day is men who can, by handling the Bible
like a gardener does his spade, cause it to be said &ldquo;The
sinners in Zion are afraid, tearfulness hath surprised the
hypocrites.&rdquo;</p>

SOWING.</h2>
<p>Those of us who live in the country are reminded, as we see
the springing corn, that some one has been at work&mdash;the
blade comes from the buried seed.&nbsp; Honest work has been done
before there can be seen the appearance of good.</p>
<p>Let those of us who work for the great harvest, be</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">mindful of what
we sow</span>.</p>
<p>Let us have nothing in the seed-basket that cannot be termed
what Jesus called &ldquo;The word of the kingdom.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There will be no difficulty in obtaining that.&nbsp; Farmers
don&rsquo;t stint the sower, and God will not withhold seed from
His labourers.&nbsp; Let the youthful preacher be encouraged, for
just as you have seen the sower fill his basket from the sack, so
there is, in the Bible, enough for each, enough for all, enough
for evermore.</p>
<p>Sow <span class="smcap">Bible ideas</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put the Bible into them, my brother,&rdquo; said an
earnest Scotch divine to us many years ago, and there is nothing
grows as well, or yields as much, as the Bible, used as
seed.&nbsp; People may tell you that they want something else,
something more attractive and pleasing.&nbsp; Yes, but they
won&rsquo;t say so in the time of harvest.&nbsp; You may plant
your field with flower-seeds, sow tulips, marigolds, mignonette,
&amp;c., those will look very well in June and July, but how
about September?&nbsp; The very people that asked for them in
spring will curse you for them in autumn.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span><span class="smcap">Bible ideas about
God</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>His love of righteousness, His hatred of evil; His love of
man, but His dislike to sin; His delight in benevolence, but His
determined hostility to wrong-doing.&nbsp; We need to show not
only God&rsquo;s pity for sinners, but His inflexible justice,
which did not spare His well-beloved Son, when He bore our
sins.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bible ideas about
Conduct</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>Never mind being called legal, if you can back your preaching
by the Bible.&nbsp; Put the truth into the people about honesty,
industry, and self-denial.&nbsp; Let others spend their time in
talking of the angels with bright wings of gold; let us teach men
how God means them to live in this world.&nbsp; Those of us who
wish to learn how to sow, should study Jesus and Paul.&nbsp; They
are examples of what sowers should be.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bible ideas about
Repentance</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things teach and exhort.&rdquo;&nbsp; One secret
of the want of lasting success, is that we do not preach
repentance.&nbsp; Men need to have right ideas on this
subject.&nbsp; Those who have not repented cannot believe unto
righteousness; they can believe unto feeling, but not to right
doing!&nbsp; It is not a question so much of tears, as of turning
away from sin.&nbsp; The greatest of penitents said, &ldquo;I
turned my feet unto thy testimonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bible ideas about Jesus</span>:&mdash;</p>
<p>That He died for us according to the scriptures.&nbsp; When
the Master wished to take away the sadness from His disciples, as
they walked to Emmaus, &ldquo;He expounded unto them in all the
scriptures the things concerning Himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
what we must do.&nbsp; Put the truth, as it is in Jesus, into the
hearts of the people.&nbsp; Let us show from the word of God,
that &ldquo;By <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>His stripes we are
healed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing gives abiding peace like the
thought, Christ has died for my sins.&nbsp; This will lead to
loving Jesus, with the kind of affection which will not be
tempted to grieve Him by doing that which is evil.&nbsp; Let us
see to it that we get the seed in.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">It is not
enough to get it on the land</span>, <span class="smcap">we must
put it in</span>.</p>
<p>No preacher has done his work thoroughly who does not use the
harrow.&nbsp; There are some so-called teachers, who don&rsquo;t
know what the gospel harrow is.&nbsp; This is why the catechism
is not taught.&nbsp; The ancient plan of catechising in the
church ought to be more general than it is.&nbsp; Why should we
not hide the word of God in the hearts of our hearers, by causing
them to think over what we have said?&nbsp; We may not be able to
get them formally to answer questions, but we may make them
think.&nbsp; Some preaching is like raking with the teeth
upwards.&nbsp; It may be easier and more speedy, but it is not so
likely to hide the seed.&nbsp; It is a good practice for those
who have been listened to by others, to talk to themselves after
the sermon or lesson is over, and to say, Soul, what hast thou
done to-day?&nbsp; How many Bible truths hast thou put into the
hearts of the people?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Didst thou put
them in</span>?</p>
<p>If thou didst, never fear but thou shalt see harvest some
day.&nbsp; His word does not return void.&nbsp; This is not true
of thy word, or of anyone else&rsquo;s, but &ldquo;the word of
the Lord abideth for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>XII.&nbsp; &ldquo;AND WE WILL&mdash;&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The prophet Micah was struck with the energy and devotion of
the heathen to their gods.&nbsp; He saw the grip these idols had
of their votaries, how no expense was spared, no sacrifice
withheld, for the sake of a filthy lie embodied in a stone or
golden image.&nbsp; While he listened to the songs of the
heathen, his heart warmed as he thought of the greatness of
Jehovah, and so he cried out&mdash;&ldquo;All people will walk
every one in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of
the Lord our God for ever and ever.&rdquo;&mdash;Micah iv. 5.</p>
<p>Why should we not serve Jehovah with the same intensity that
the heathen shew in their worship?&nbsp; Why should not holiness
to the Lord be as enthusiastic and powerful in the lives of
Christians as sin formerly was?&nbsp; Why should not men be as
much moved by the indwelling Spirit, as they were when full of
drink?&nbsp; For instance, you may see, when a man is half drunk,
how his pocket is opened; he will stand treat all round; every
one in the room may have whatever he likes to order, &ldquo;Give
it a name!&rdquo; says the drink-inspired heart.&nbsp; Now, we
ask, why should not those who are under the power of the Holy
Ghost go to some poor widows and &ldquo;stand treat all
round,&rdquo; by taking the fatherless children to some shop
where their poor naked feet shall be well shod?</p>
<p>Shall we not have a shout over the perseverance and patient
continuance of the converts?&nbsp; See the worshippers of <!--
page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>the race horse, as, whipped and spurred, the winner
draws out from the ruck and passes the post first!&nbsp; How the
mad votaries of the gambling idol make the air ring with their
cries!&nbsp; And shall not we be as interested as we see men and
women contend successfully for &ldquo;the prize?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is
not the cant sometimes on the side of those who are so anxious
for what they call decorum?&nbsp; Let us like Micah, say,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">We will</span>,&rdquo; too.&nbsp; How
hard it is to win the heathen over to leave their false
gods!&nbsp; And shall we not walk for ever and ever in
Jehovah&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; Why should not Satan and all who help
him regard efforts to make apostates as a forlorn hope?&nbsp; O
for a strong grip of God!&nbsp; Do some of our readers feel their
weakness, and tremble lest they should go back to the assemblies
of the heathen?&nbsp; Let us remind them of the
promise&mdash;&ldquo;I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they
shall walk up and down in His name.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Zech. x.
12.)</p>
<p>Most of those who serve the devil mean to forsake him before
they die.&nbsp; They are self-deceived in many cases, and die as
they live.&nbsp; Let us determine that &ldquo;for ever and
ever&rdquo; shall be our motto.&nbsp; &ldquo;Signed for
life,&rdquo; as the teetotaler sometimes says.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
God is our God for ever and ever.&nbsp; He will be our guide even
unto death.&rdquo;&nbsp; We need a guide all the way, till we
come to the other side of Jordan.&nbsp; After then, no
possibility of falling or loss; but though we shall need no
guide, we shall delight in the Lord for ever.&nbsp; When this
paper comes into the hands of our readers, the <span
class="smcap">Conference</span> will have begun its
Sittings.&nbsp; Let every Methodist, from Dan to Beersheba, say,
&ldquo;We will sustain the new President with our prayers, as we
did the man of God who went before him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Lord
whom our fathers served shall rejoice in the energy and patient
continuance <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>of His people.&nbsp; He shall not
complain that we worked harder and sacrificed more for the Gods
we served before, than we do for Him; but the heathen shall see
signs of the greatness of Jehovah in the enthusiasm and
perseverance of His people.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;AS LONG AS HE LIVETH HE SHALL BE LENT TO THE
LORD.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Two things are worthy of notice here.&nbsp; First, Hannah
brought her son to God&rsquo;s house and left him there to
minister.&nbsp; In this she kept the vow she had made (see verse
11).&nbsp; If all promises made in days of trouble were kept as
this woman kept hers, there would be some wondrous changes.&nbsp;
We must not suppose that Hannah did not feel the removal of her
beloved son from her own home, but she made the sacrifice, and
God honoured her to all time by recording her gratitude in the
Book of books, and made her son a national blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Samuel stayed
where his Mother put him</span>.</p>
<p>He began to be a minister when a child, and he continued to be
so to the end of his life.&nbsp; Few lives have been so
honourable and honoured as his was.&nbsp; But it would not have
been so if he had not continued to serve the God of his
mother.&nbsp; Are there not some of our readers who are tempted
to leave the Bible and Sunday school, and to turn their backs on
the religion of their parents?&nbsp; Remember that to turn your
back on the God of your mother is to hoard up dishonour and
misery for yourself and those dear to you, for what Hannah sang
is yet true,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go somewhere else and preach, you ignorant
peasant!&nbsp; What do you come here for, spoiling our enjoyment,
and keeping us awake at nights?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know this
is no common conventicle?&nbsp; It is the place where the king

head!&rdquo;&nbsp; So said Amaziah, the priest, and so says many
a one to-day.&nbsp; Cannot you let us rest in the enjoyment of
our sins?&nbsp; You seem to forget that our god is made of</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Gold</span>!</p>
<p>We are not common pot-house people!&nbsp; Preach against
drunkenness, if you like; that is a sin which increases the
rates!&nbsp; Preach against prostitution, for we are afraid our
sons will be entrapped some of these days.&nbsp; Preach against
love of dress, or anything else that costs money, for we have to

home to Tekoa, and spend the rest of your time looking after the
cattle?&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, verily, but till I die, I will make
Jeroboam howl with rage and vexation of spirit, for he follows
the sins of the man who made Israel to sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
the work of the preacher to bring hell within sight of those,
who, by their selfish love of gold, make others to sin.&nbsp; Let
the king know that I will make him feel as though his crown was
red hot.&nbsp; His honours shall burn him, and his <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>food
shall scorch his tongue.&nbsp; It is in the king&rsquo;s chapel
where I will preach as I never preach anywhere else, for it is
Jeroboam against whom I am sent.</p>
<p>O! Amos, lift up thy voice with strength against these
worshippers of golden calves!&nbsp; Remember thy spiritual
ancestry.&nbsp; Forget not the prophet that came from Judah many
a year ago.&nbsp; How he testified against that golden god, and
how Jeroboam&rsquo;s arm was paralyzed when he would have had the
prophet slain.&nbsp; Why are we so mealy-mouthed in denouncing
these golden-idol men?&nbsp; Is not the worship of money the
hidden nourisher of public sin?&nbsp; Could the gin-palace exist
but for the worship of Mammon?&nbsp; Could those streets of bad
houses in London and other large towns flaunt their shame, were
it not for high rents?&nbsp; They pay well!&nbsp; As sure as
there is a God in heaven, shall these, who make money out of the
sin of others, gnash their teeth in endless torment.&nbsp;
Amos!&nbsp; He is in thy congregation!&nbsp; Do not preach to him
of Heaven! but <span class="smcap">Hell</span>!&nbsp; Thou art

portion in their iron safe!&nbsp; Let them feel that hell is

Amaziah! wouldest thou send the rough-tongued prophet away?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thy wife shall be an harlot, and thou shalt
die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shame while thou dost live, and a dishonoured
grave, for this is the portion of those who would hinder faithful

<span class="smcap">Deut.</span> i. 38.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Encourage&rdquo; who?&nbsp; Why, your new
Minister.&nbsp; He will need it.&nbsp; No one but God knows how
much some men suffer in leaving old friends and going among
strangers.&nbsp; One of our most popular preachers told us that
when he goes into a new circuit, he feels like a tree that has
been transplanted, and for a time seems nearer death than
life.&nbsp; And it is more than likely the man who has just come
to your place is feeling acutely the separation from old friends,
and the strangeness of everything around him.&nbsp; Do not be
surprised, then, if he is not as friendly at first, as the man
was who has gone away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Encourage Him</span>!&rdquo; for
there will be plenty to do the other thing.&nbsp; The enemy of
souls, when he is not able to turn back God&rsquo;s soldier, will
do all he can to wound him, and if he can hire some fool of a
Christian to do it, all the better for his purpose.&nbsp; It will
be easy to discourage by quarrels, jealousy and
fault-finding.&nbsp; In fact, it requires so little mental
ability to find fault, there is no difficulty in finding someone
to do that, but don&rsquo;t let it be you.&nbsp; Someone else
will see to it that the new Minister has not too easy a time of
it.&nbsp; But do you try your utmost to make him feel that he has
come where all he does will be appreciated, and that he will
never need to go out of his own circuit to find those who will
love him for his works&rsquo; sake, till they know him well
enough to love him for his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Encourage
Him</span>,&rdquo;&mdash;by being at the services regularly, <!--

30</span>and in time, and especially at the Prayer-Meeting.&nbsp;
Stay to the Sunday night one, and go to the one held in the
week.&nbsp; What a comfort for the Minister to see the vestry
filled when he gets to the Weekly Prayer-Meeting! and when you
are there, or on your knees at home, pray for him; for if Paul
needed the prayers of the Church, much more do the Preachers
to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Encourage Him</span>!&rdquo; by
taking the advice he gives you when he is in the pulpit.&nbsp; A
doctor would feel it if his medicine was treated as many sermons
are.&nbsp; What would the medical man think if he saw the bottle
of physic poured down the sink, or left in the bottle untasted,
till there was a cupboard full of bottles?&nbsp; He would not
feel like preparing any more.&nbsp; How a preacher is encouraged
to make fresh sermons, when he sees that his last was taken into
the heart and life of some of his hearers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Encourage Him</span>!&rdquo; by
letting him know of anyone who has received good from his
preaching or visits.&nbsp; You need not be afraid of making him
proud.&nbsp; He has had enough of the other kind, or, as we
sometimes say, he is sure to have &ldquo;a stone in the other
pocket.&rdquo;&nbsp; We remember visiting one of our sick
class-leaders one Monday, who said, &ldquo;Who was the young man
who preached here last night?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, that was
the new Minister!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you must tell him a
woman was converted.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Encourage Him</span>,&rdquo; and James says,
&ldquo;If one convert him, <span class="smcap">Let him
know</span>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet we need it very much</span>.&nbsp; We
are in great weakness, and we need power, for there is a great
multitude come against us.&nbsp; It is not the wisest policy to
ignore the strength of our enemy.&nbsp; Jehoshaphat did
not.&nbsp; It is well for us to know the strength of our foes,
but let it not lead us to despair.&nbsp; Who shall number the
host of the foes against whom we must fight?&nbsp; They come to
rob us of our inheritance, and if we submit, we shall be
enslaved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have no might, but <span
class="smcap">we know who has</span>.&nbsp; The pious king said
(verse 6), &ldquo;In Thine hand is there not power and might, Art
not Thou God?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is there more than one God?&nbsp; Some
Christians talk as though the Lord had been obliged to give up
some of His power to Bradlaugh &amp; Co.&nbsp; Where is the sign
of a divided kingship?&nbsp; Could all the host of God&rsquo;s
foes have prevented the earthquakes?&nbsp; Do they know when the
next will take place?&nbsp; It is still true that God
&ldquo;shaketh the earth and the pillars thereof tremble&rdquo;
(Job ix. 6)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This awful God is ours,<br />
Our Father and our love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We know how to get Might</span>, <span
class="smcap">for we can Pray</span>.&nbsp; Jehoshaphat did not
first of all review his troops, he called a meeting for
prayer.&nbsp; The nation fasted and prayed, and the king led the
devotions of his people.&nbsp; What a prayer!&nbsp; Have you
noticed the four questions he puts to his God?&nbsp; <!-- page
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>And
with what pathos he says &ldquo;Our eyes are upon
Thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; Shall not the people of God imitate
Judah?&nbsp; &ldquo;They gathered themselves together to ask help
of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should we not make this the motto
of our weekly prayer meetings&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To Ask
Help</span>.</p>
<p>Not only the men, but the women and children came to the
meeting.&nbsp; Would not the mothers and the little ones
pray?&nbsp; They knew that their foes would carry them away
captive, if God did not help.&nbsp; Would it not be well to
encourage our children to cry to the Lord?&nbsp; Would He not
hear them, think you?</p>
<p>Promise of the needed help soon came.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost
fell upon one of the sons of Asaph, and he soon told his
message:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The
Battle is not yours</span>, <span class="smcap">but
God&rsquo;s</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He always makes His people&rsquo;s cause His own, when they
trust Him.&nbsp; Shall we not live so that our lives shall become
part of the divine estate?&nbsp; So that we cannot be hurt
without its injuring the Lord of heaven?&nbsp; &ldquo;The Lord
will be with you on the morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is some preacher
reading this on the Saturday night?&nbsp; It may be some young
Minister, or Local Preacher, who is fearing for his reputation,
or for the ark of God.&nbsp; Brother, read over with care this
address of the Levite, v. 15&ndash;17.&nbsp; Then, like the godly
monarch, shew others how to praise the Lord.&nbsp; It is well to
notice that the people, led by their ministers, stood up to
praise the Lord, and on the next day, before the victory, they
praised the Lord.&nbsp; What a scene it must have been!&nbsp; How
the angels would keep time with their harps, as the choir sang
the anthem, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! for His mercy endureth for
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Lord did that.&nbsp; He sent His hosts, and all that Judah
needed to do was to gather the spoil.&nbsp; When shall we spoil
our foes?&nbsp; When shall we loot the devil?&nbsp; How
one&rsquo;s fingers itch to take his goods!&nbsp; The time is
coming when we shall gather the wealth and power he now
possesses, when the hosts of darkness shall come against the
people of God only to be slain; and when there shall be no
difficulty in raising money for good objects, for the
devil&rsquo;s coffers shall be at our service.&nbsp; Let us not
lose sight of the fact that the same week the great multitude
came against the Lord&rsquo;s inheritance, there were more
precious jewels than could be carried away, and the place where

<p>Why not?&nbsp; What possible objection can there be to perfect
Christianity?&nbsp; You like perfection in other things.&nbsp;
You like your watch to keep &ldquo;perfect time.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
you are measured for a coat, you like &ldquo;a perfect
fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; You like other people to be perfect in their
actions, so far as you are concerned.&nbsp; You wish your
children to obey you; your wife to love you without ever
wavering; those who owe you money to pay up twenty shillings to
the pound; your servants to do their work according to order; in
a word, if you served God as you wish everybody to serve you, you
would be a perfect man.&nbsp; Is that so?&nbsp; Then why object
to &ldquo;Christian Perfection?&rdquo;&nbsp; You say,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">I
don&rsquo;t believe in sinless perfection</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, we wish to be practical and to do you good, and so we
will take lower ground.&nbsp; Do you believe that it is possible
for God to make you a very much better man than you are?&nbsp; O
yes!&nbsp; Then why not allow Him to have His own way?&nbsp; Is
this not the reason why some men are not striving after
&ldquo;Perfection?&rdquo; They like to be as they are.&nbsp;
Going forward means suffering, self-denial, a
struggle,&mdash;&ldquo;There are giants in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some other time we will try to encourage those who are really
anxious to possess the good land, by shewing that Joshua and
Caleb were right in saying of the sons of Anak, &ldquo;They are
bread for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The bigger they are the more
<!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>there is for us to eat;&rdquo; but just now, we are
anxious to shew these non-believers in perfection, that, till
they are all God is prepared to make them, they must not say a
word against our doctrine.</p>
<p>May you not be speaking against God&rsquo;s power to heal, to
make whole?&nbsp; Is it not a reflection on the Divine Workman,
to say that he cannot restore man to be so that He can say once
more, &ldquo;It is very good?&rdquo;&nbsp; It behoves us to speak
with bated breath here, but we may venture to say that the grace
which made an Enoch, can make a nineteenth century saint, so
lovely in his character, that all men shall say, &ldquo;This is
God&rsquo;s own work, and is like all things which come from His
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">But many
of these who profess to have obtained this blessing are so
manifestly mistaken</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, we agree with you there.&nbsp; Before long we shall have
something to say to those who believe in &ldquo;Christian
Perfection,&rdquo; but we are dealing now with those who do
not.&nbsp; We think that those who are &ldquo;perfect,&rdquo;
will often be the last to profess it.&nbsp; Any way, they will
have very little to say about themselves, though their mouths
will be filled with the praise of God, who has done great things
for them.&nbsp; We almost always suspect those who have too much
to say, and wish we could make them to see how their loud talk
and small deeds tell against the doctrine.&nbsp; One proof that a
man is not perfect, is his censoriousness concerning those who do
not see things as he does, or call them by the same name.&nbsp;
But of these we will speak at another time.&nbsp; What we are now
concerned about is that we should strive to be all that God has
promised to make us, and thus become living expositions of the
ability of the Lord to answer Paul&rsquo;s petition:&mdash;</p>

36</span>XVII.&nbsp; &ldquo;MAKE THIS VALLEY FULL OF
DITCHES.&rdquo;<br />
2 <span class="smcap">Kings</span>, iii., 16.</h2>
<p>What for?&nbsp; To receive that without which they must
perish.&nbsp; We read in verse 9 &ldquo;There was no
water.&rdquo;&nbsp; Application was made to the prophet Elisha,
who declared that there should soon be plenty, but that the army
must at once make channels for it to flow in.&nbsp; This was
done, and during the offering of the morning sacrifice, water
came in abundance, and filled the ditches.</p>
<p>Let us be ready for great blessing.&nbsp; We need an
outpouring of the Spirit, but are we ready for it?&nbsp; Would
not a great revival surprise many Christians?&nbsp; In London,
Messrs. Moody and Sankey will soon begin their work, and the
Christians of that city should be on the look-out for great
results.&nbsp; Doubtless there are committee meetings, and much
organization is going on, but the work must not be left to
organizations.&nbsp; Let every Christian in London make a ditch
to bring the living water to his own home.</p>
<p>We hope to hear that in Liverpool, where Mr. Hughes is so soon
to begin work, and in the places where the other connexional
evangelists are preaching, the gospel channels will be dug by
Methodists&rsquo; hands.&nbsp; All three of these devoted men
wish that our people should prepare the way, and thus have the
stream of blessing flow to their hearts and homes.&nbsp; The
District Missionaries also are needing help.&nbsp; Let us make it
easier work for them, by opening the way.&nbsp; We know digging
means work, and some Christians are so very respectable, they
would feel insulted <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>if God asked them to become one of
His navvies.&nbsp; On the other hand, there are thousands of our
people who would be glad to help if only some one would show them
the way.</p>
<p>But what is laid upon our hearts most of all is, that
something more should be done to assist Circuit Ministers and
Local Preachers to evangelize.&nbsp; If nothing is effected
besides what is done by the men set apart as evangelists, we
shall have a large portion of the country unwatered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Make the valley full of ditches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let every
Methodist feel, that till every impediment is taken out of the
way, and every thing done to help on a revival in his own
circuit, and in his own chapel, his work is not finished.&nbsp;
If each does his best, there will soon be a flowing of
water.&nbsp; Do we hear some say, &ldquo;There are so many among
us who will not dig?&rdquo;&nbsp; Just so, and therefore some of
us must dig night and day.&nbsp; Get the spade called
&ldquo;Prayer,&rdquo; and keep it bright.&nbsp; Let the prayer
meeting become</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">A Gang of
Excavators</span>!</p>
<p>Let us not be satisfied till we are sure that, when the
revival comes, we shall be ready.</p>
<p>Let our Class-leaders make enquiry how many of their members
are praying and working for a revival.&nbsp; Let everything be
done to make our ordinary services very attractive.&nbsp; Let our
Choirs, and those who have charge of the musical part of the
services, do their part to make the singing pleasant and
lively.&nbsp; It is a grievous thing to note how slovenly this
part of the service is in some places.&nbsp; For instance, in
many chapels where they have a chant-book, the run is on three or
four.&nbsp; It is a symptom of inertness when <span
class="smcap">Stella</span> is sung as though it were the only
6-8&rsquo;s tune.&nbsp; Will someone see to it, that a ditch is
dug to every singing pew in Methodism?</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>We repeat the question.&nbsp; Are we ready for an
outpouring of the Spirit?&nbsp; Have we all the channels cleaned
out which our fathers dug, and are we digging fresh ones?&nbsp;
Do we look as if a revival would be welcomed?&nbsp; Does the
enemy know that he may expect an attack, or is he chuckling over
our rusty spades and swords?</p>
<h3>A WORD TO PARENTS.</h3>
<p>Brother Moses Welsby was speaking with me at some Open-air
Meetings at Radcliffe, the other day, and he told of seeing a lad
being taken to prison, and as he was going his father called out,
&ldquo;Keep thy spirits up, lad, it will soon be over,&rdquo; but
the lad replied,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">I should
not be going now if you had shewed me a better
example</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What sort of a model are you?&nbsp; Can your children copy you
with safety?&nbsp; Are your actions what you would like to see
over again in your boys and girls?&nbsp; Perhaps some who read
this are in danger of being driven from God at the last
day.&nbsp; If so, shall you be chained to your children, and will
your punishment be all the greater because they say,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">We
should not have been in hell if you had set us a better
example</span>?&rdquo;</p>

39</span>XVIII.&nbsp; &ldquo;THERE IS A SOUND OF ABUNDANCE OF
RAIN.&rdquo;<br />
1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span>, xix. 41.</h2>
<p>So said the man of God.&nbsp; Rain was much needed, for famine
stared them in the face.&nbsp; Even Ahab himself had walked many
weary miles to seek grass for his horses; other men&rsquo;s
cattle had perished, and if the drought had continued, everything
would have died.&nbsp; Still, it was not Ahab who heard the sound
of the rain.&nbsp; There was no sign of it.&nbsp; The heavens
were as brass, the sky was without a cloud, everything was burned
up with dry heat, and yet, said Elijah, &ldquo;There is a sound
of abundance of rain.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is so in the spiritual
world.&nbsp; There are those who know of a coming Revival long
before there is any sign.&nbsp; They have felt their prayers
being answered, and have heard the cry of the penitent sinner,
though, as yet, he seems to be as hard and careless as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So <span class="smcap">Ahab went up to Eat and to
Drink</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not so Elijah, he went up to the top
of Carmel.&nbsp; The man of God &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cast
Himself down on the Earth</span>, <span class="smcap">and put his
Face between his Knees</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those who would
procure blessings must not expect to win them at the table of
luxury and ease, but by climbing the hill of difficulty, and in
the humbling of self.&nbsp; If we would bring the blessing down,
we must be prepared to say, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; to our own likings,
and to refuse that which would gratify flesh and blood.&nbsp; If
we would prevail in prayer, we must be alone with God.&nbsp; The
priests who fed at Jezebel&rsquo;s table could not bring rain, or
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>they would have saved themselves from the sword of
Elijah.&nbsp; We need not to look toward the sea till we have
bowed before the Lord, then we may expect some sign of the coming
Revival.</p>
<p>We must not be discouraged if the servant tells us
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There is Nothing</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Masters see more than servants can, or they would not be
masters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go again seven times,&rdquo; as though he
said &ldquo;Do not interrupt me with thy
&lsquo;Nothings!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Come and tell me when there
is &ldquo;Something;&rdquo; and the seventh time he saw the
&ldquo;little cloud.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of us have looked from the
hill, over the sea, in a far off tropical land, and have seen
that same little cloud many a time, as it spread all over the
sky, and soon there was rain enough to stop the traveller.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">And so shall it
be in Methodism ere long</span>.</p>
<p>If we mistake not, last Sunday&rsquo;s work among our young
people is the result of many earnest prayers, and the sign of
coming prosperity.</p>
<p>Some will be ready to say &ldquo;It is nothing to make a stir
about.&nbsp; They were only children.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A
little cloud!&rdquo;&nbsp; Only the size of a man&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Yes, but what man?&nbsp; &ldquo;The man Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ahab, get thee down, that the rain
stop thee not.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall not be surprised to hear of
Revivals like some we have known, which turned other meetings
into soul-converting agencies.&nbsp; Tea Meetings, and Missionary
Meetings, where the people have come in crowds, not to applaud
eloquence, but to ask&mdash;&ldquo;What must we do to be
saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; We expect news of this sort, and that, ere
long.&nbsp; May the hand of the Lord be on Elijah, then shall he
run before Ahab, and prayer shall be mightier than the power
which moves those who eat and drink!</p>

41</span>XIX.&nbsp; A CLEAN TONGUE.</h2>
<p>One of the first things the doctor does when he comes to see
you, is to ask to look at your tongue, and one glance will tell
him how much difficulty he has to contend with.&nbsp; If the
tongue is foul, he knows that there is inward mischief, and he
must lose no time in cleansing that of which the tongue is but an
indicator.</p>
<p>As we pass along our streets our ears are assailed with
language of the most horrid description.&nbsp; If one needed any
information as to the state of public morals, the foul-mouthed
men and boys, aye, and we regret to say, too often, women and
girls, would tell of the state of heart into which many thousands
of our country people have been corrupted.&nbsp; And in many
cases, this has become habitual, and what might be termed
natural.</p>
<p>Can nothing be done?&nbsp; Is the name of the Divine Being and
that of our Saviour to be profaned constantly without any
check?&nbsp; If so, it will grow worse and worse, until we may
expect national sin to bring down national punishment, and we
shall have to say, &ldquo;Because of swearing the land
mourneth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who have charge of the education of our children might
help, by constantly speaking against bad language, <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and
by punishing those who continue to offend.&nbsp; Parents, also,
should check the slightest tendency in this direction.&nbsp; We
have heard of a good woman, who, overhearing one of her boys
using what she called &ldquo;dirty words,&rdquo; took him to the
sink, and washed out his mouth, not sparing the soap!&nbsp;
Sometimes when we have heard men defiling their tongues with
filthy talk, we have wished their mothers had served them the
same.</p>
<p>Nor is this offence against God and good taste always confined
to the ignorant.&nbsp; There are those who have been well
taught&mdash;men of ability, and some who make a profession of
religion, who indulge in unseemly language, and delight in
stories which are termed &ldquo;smutty.&rdquo;&nbsp; We know how
farmers dislike the &ldquo;smut&rdquo; in their wheat, how an
otherwise good crop will be lowered in value, because the black
grain will, when ground, darken the flour.&nbsp; Is it not so
with these men of unclean lips?&nbsp; The filthy allusions and
improper stories which pollute their conversation make their life
infectious, and their companionship dangerous.&nbsp; Let us
reprove them, or at least avoid them, as we would the plague.</p>
<p>If we would keep a clean tongue, we must pray &ldquo;Create in
me a clean heart, O God!&rdquo;&nbsp; This can be done, and the
Lord, who has told us that He will not admit into His heaven that
which worketh abomination, will gladly cleanse the thoughts of
our hearts by the inspiration of His holy Spirit, then shall our
tongue glorify Him continually.</p>
<p>Should this fall into the hands of one of those whose foul
tongue shews that his heart is corrupt, we would ask him how he
would like to have his conversation reported by a short-hand
writer, and printed in the &ldquo;Standard,&rdquo; or <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&ldquo;Daily News,&rdquo; with his name attached?&nbsp;
But is it not a fact, that his words are being taken down, and
when the books are opened before an assembled universe at the
last day, will not his soul tremble, as he finds that God has
listened all the time, and the language used years ago, is to
control his destiny, for He who will come to be our Judge has
said to the swearer and filthy speaker&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">By thy
word thou shalt be condemned</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A WORD TO FATHERS.</h3>
<p>Have you ever thought how it is that in the prayer we call our
Lord&rsquo;s, God is spoken of as Father?&nbsp; Do you not see
that your child calls you by one of the names&mdash;the
Christ-chosen name of the Devine Being?&nbsp; Is there not a
sermon in that to everyone of us who has children of his
own?&nbsp; Perhaps you have never given the matter a thought that
for some of the early years of you children you may be giving
them a caricature of God in your ungodly conduct.&nbsp; Let us
lay this to heart, and strive, by God-like actions, to teach our
little ones what God is like.&nbsp; By long suffering and
gentleness towards ignorance and weakness;&mdash;by stern
denunciation, in life as well as word, of everything that is mean
and deceitful;&mdash;by delighting in mercy, and readiness to
give to those who need, to our children, &ldquo;Our
Father,&rdquo; may become a stepping stone to the knowledge of
God.</p>

44</span>XX.&nbsp; THE RED LAMP.</h2>
<p>Travelling by express train the other day, we found that we
were stopped a long distance from the station where we were timed
to stop, and looking out of the window, saw a red light
ahead.&nbsp; That accounted for it, we knew there was something
in the way.&nbsp; The driver knew what he was about, and though
anxious to go on, did not move until the red light was changed to
white.</p>
<p>Some of those who read this paper are living in sin.&nbsp; To
such, the Bible speaks out in plain terms, and, like the Red
Light, would stop them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The End
of these things is Death</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You cannot go any further without danger.&nbsp; Why run the
risk?&nbsp; That Red Lamp seems to say, &ldquo;If you will come
on, you will be slain.&rdquo;&nbsp; What should we think of any
one who urged the driver to go on, in spite of the warning?&nbsp;
Would you not call him &ldquo;fool&rdquo; and
&ldquo;madman?&rdquo;&nbsp; Just so, and you will do well to call
those who urge you to despise the warnings of the Bible, by the
same names.</p>
<p>We should not think much of the wisdom of any one who said of
the Red Lamp, &ldquo;Why take any notice of that old-fashioned
thing?&nbsp; We have outgrown these childish ideas!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Would not your reply be, &ldquo;Danger is danger, and safety is
safety!&rdquo;&nbsp; We have not outgrown death and the grave,
and it is still true, in spite of the march of science, that a
train coming into collision with another means suffering to those
who are in it.&nbsp; Sin is yet sin, and we cannot break the
Commandments <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of God without having to
suffer.&nbsp; And as for the Bible being old-fashioned, we feel,
that which kept our fathers from hell shall keep their sons
also.</p>
<p>Here is one of the Red Lamps of the Bible, which young men
would do well to consider&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Her
House is the Way to Hell</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young man, there is the Red Light!&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; Do not go
one step further!&nbsp; There are plenty of fools to tell you
that</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">This is
seeing Life</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible says&mdash;&ldquo;The dead are there, and her guests
are in the depths of hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; If everything had to be
called by its right name, just as sign-boards tell us what is to
be procured within, like &ldquo;Furniture Dealer,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Boot and Shoe Maker,&rdquo; fancy the sign-board that
would have to be put over the house of the &ldquo;strange
woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is a suitable inscription, which we take
from the Bible.&mdash;Prov. ii. 19:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">None
that go unto her return again</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is putting a Red Lamp over her door, is it not?&nbsp;
Will you heed the warning?&nbsp; Or do you mean to be one of
those of whom the Bible speaks,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And thou shalt mourn at
the last</span>, <span class="smcap">when thy flesh and thy body
are consumed</span>, <span class="smcap">and say</span>,

<p>In finding illustrations for our teaching at the river-side,

<p>There are not a few who read our paper, who will be on the
lookout to know as soon as possible, whether</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Dark or Light
Blue</span></p>
<p>has won.&nbsp; For ourselves we care not, but we are anxious
to make use of the contest as a parable, before the race is
forgotten.</p>
<p>If you would row as to obtain, you must mind certain things,
and these are pictures of what we must do, would we gain the
heavenly prize.</p>
<h3>I.&mdash;WE MUST KEEP THE BODY UNDER.</h3>
<p>So thought Paul.&mdash;See 1st Cor. ix, 25 and 27.&nbsp; Those
sixteen young fellows who will pull the oars in the race, have,
for months, been undergoing strict physical training.&nbsp; This
means abstinence from all that could be said to weaken the frame,
or lower the action of the heart.&nbsp; There are only certain
things they may eat and drink.&nbsp; They must have the right
amount of sleep, and no more.&nbsp; Exercise of the most bracing
kind they must take every day, and eschew every practice that
could weaken the nerves or muscles in the slightest degree.</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>And he that would win the heavenly race must say
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; to self, and &ldquo;flee youthful lusts,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;endure hardness.&rdquo;&nbsp; He whose soul can be
mastered by his body has lost the bridle, and cannot wonder if he
lose the prize.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;WE MUST SECURE A GOOD START.</h3>
<p>Just before the Starter gives the word to go, the men paddle
till the cord which the coxswain holds at arm&rsquo;s length is
tight, and every man has his oar ready for the dash into the
water and away.&nbsp; To lose time at the start is to find that a
chance has been thrown away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember thy Creator in the days of thy
youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They that seek Me early shall find
Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He who would be a first-class Christian, must
begin betimes.&nbsp; Time lost is lee-way, that cannot be
recovered, strive as we like.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;WE MUST BE WELL STEERED.</h3>
<p>In the picture parable you can see who is steering.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let him come aboard you!&nbsp; Proverbs iii. 6, tells
you whom to trust with the tiller ropes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">He shall
direct thy paths</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If young men would only let the Bible &ldquo;coach
them,&rdquo; they would be saved from many a blunder and
defeat.&nbsp; It is important to have, as steersman, one who
knows the currents, and just when to alter the course.&nbsp; The
youngster who steers the University boat has been up and down the
river many a time, till he has learned everything he needs to
know.&nbsp; Let me ask you, &ldquo;Who steers?&rdquo;&nbsp; If
<span class="smcap">Self-will</span> does, you are undone.</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;NEVER CEASE STRIVING TILL YOU HAVE WON.</h3>
<p>Your adversary will not.&nbsp; He will pursue you till you
have gained the prize.&nbsp; &ldquo;He who to the end
endures,&rdquo; is the <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>saved man.&nbsp; It is very
instructive to note how many backsliders there are among
professors of mature age.&nbsp; The most grievous cases of
falling away are not from the ranks of young disciples, but from
those who ought to have been safe examples for them!&nbsp; If you
have lived to be grey-headed, remember your silver hair may make
a fool&rsquo;s cap yet!&nbsp; There are other lessons, but they
will keep till another year.&nbsp; We will end our Sermon with
some lines of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s, not known to all our
readers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But did the great apostle fear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He should not to the end endure,<br />
Should not hold out, and persevere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And make his own election sure?<br />
Could Paul believe it possible,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When all his toils and griefs were past,<br />
Himself should of salvation fail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And die a reprobate at last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then art thou that dar&rsquo;st reject<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sacred terms, the humbling awe,<br />
As absolutely saved,&mdash;elect,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And free from an abolished law?<br />
<span class="smcap">Dost thou no self-denial need</span>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">No watch</span>, <span
class="smcap">or abstinence severe</span>;<br />
In one short moment perfected!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An angel&mdash;an immortal here?&rdquo;</p>

49</span>XXII.&nbsp; GOOD-FRIDAY.</h2>
<p>One wonders how it came to have that name!&nbsp; We cannot
help feeling, that if other titles were as well-deserved, it
would be a blessing to the world.&nbsp; For instance, if
Nobleman, Gentleman, Reverend, &amp;c., were as descriptive as
this day&rsquo;s name, there would be many happier people than
there are.</p>
<p>No wonder that it should be called &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; for it
helps us to look back to the time when the best action the world
has known, or can know, was done.&nbsp; We gaze upon the Cross,
and we thank God for His unspeakable gift.&nbsp; One knows not
which to admire the most: the Love that could smite the
Well-beloved, or the Love that could, for the sake of enemies,
bear the blow?</p>
<p>How do our readers mean to spend the day?&nbsp; We have no
right to bind any man&rsquo;s conscience, and seek to have others
do as we do, except they are led in the same direction, and yet
we wonder how those who observe the day at all, can allow
themselves to spend it in dissipation.</p>
<p>We are no admirer of those who make the day one of sadness and
gloom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">It is
GOOD-FRIDAY</span>,</p>
<p>and we cannot understand how men can allow themselves to act
as though it were Bad Friday, as though they could hear the
hammer nailing Christ to the cross.&nbsp; A high
churchman&rsquo;s conscience is a wonderful thing, and in nothing
is it so <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>surprising as this, that it can allow
itself to act as though Jesus were slain and in His tomb!&nbsp;
Has not the Lord Himself spoken?&nbsp; Let us listen to Him who
speaks in rebuke to those who would darken our homes and places
of worship, and cheat themselves into a sentimentality which
again sees the corpse of Jesus laid in Joseph&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">I am He
that liveth and was dead</span>, <span class="smcap">and behold I
am alive for Evermore</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cannot be pleasing to Jesus to be spoken of as though He
was once more in the hands of His enemies.</p>
<p>While we regret that so many people in our country should make
this day one of rioting and extravagance, we are sure that it is
in some degree a reaction from the usages of those who would have
us spend the day in sorrow.&nbsp; That which is unreal must in
time become unsatisfactory, and those who would compel us to live
over again the sorrows of Calvary, may drive us to football, or
that which is worse!&nbsp; Let men once think that the church has
turned actor, and they will say, &ldquo;No, we will go to the
theatre, for there the acting is better done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Every day</span> we should visit in spirit
the cross of Jesus, for every day we need the merit of the
atonement, and the stimulus of that example of
self-forgetfulness.&nbsp; Let us turn away from the so-called
realism which would hang the world in black, and, at the same
time let us avoid those who would make this a day of
revelry.&nbsp; There is a middle path, one upon which Christ
smiles, and a path we can tread any day, and thus make it <span
class="smcap">good</span>&mdash;we mean the</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">pathway of
self-sacrifice</span>.</p>
<p>For the joy of blessing others, let us be willing to endure
shame or pain.&nbsp; There is always pleasure to be earned by
<!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>those who are willing to pay the price,&mdash;the
pleasure of unselfishness,&mdash;but this cannot be tasted except
by those who seek their highest joy in the wellbeing of
others.&nbsp; Our risen and glorified Lord tastes this joy every
day, Good-Friday not excepted, and we think it will lead us to
spend the day according to His will, if we seek for ourselves all
the blessings He purchased with His blood, and none more
earnestly than that sanctifying Spirit who will help us to follow
His blessed example, and, by caring others,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">make every
good</span>.</p>

52</span>XXIII.&nbsp; PETER THE PREACHER.</h2>
<p>Yes! the Preacher! for it is in this way he has earned the
right to be remembered.&nbsp; Perhaps his sermon at Pentecost was
more remarkable in its results than any sermon has been
since.&nbsp; The question arises in the minds of thinking men,
&ldquo;Is there any reason why preaching now should be less
effective than it was when men first began to preach the Gospel
of Jesus Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; One thing is certain, human nature
has not improved, and hell is as great a fact now as then.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s love for men has not decreased.&nbsp; He is still
interested in the human race, and the promise, as Peter put it,
is &ldquo;to all that are afar off.&rdquo;&mdash;Acts ii. 39.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Why</span>, <span class="smcap">then</span>, <span
class="smcap">do we not see the same results</span>?</p>
<p>We do in kind, but not in number.&nbsp; Why not in both?&nbsp;
Is not the answer to be found in Acts i. 14?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These all continued with one accord in
prayer and supplication.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is not the Church of to-day weak in the knee?&nbsp; Do we pray
as the men and women did who waited for the promise of the Father
in the upper room?&nbsp; Peter would pray.&nbsp; He had all the
instinct of a preacher, and would feel his heart bound at the
thought that he was to be a witness of God&rsquo;s readiness to
pardon.&nbsp; His prayer would differ from many others.&nbsp; How
he would plead for the power that would crown him with the diadem
of a preacher!&nbsp; There was a time when he had
prayed&mdash;&ldquo;Depart from me, for I am a sinful
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, his cry would be&mdash;&ldquo;Come to me,
let not <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>my sins cause Thee to stay, but come
quickly.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many of us who feel we need to
cry to Peter&rsquo;s Saviour and Lord, for we have allowed doubts
to hide His face, or self-indulgence to fence Him about.&nbsp;
Let every preacher who reads these words unite with us in
pleading for a Pentecost that shall renew our commission, and
make all men to know that a risen Saviour is our King, and a
promised Comforter our portion,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">What a blow to
Socinianism</span>, <span class="smcap">both of idea and
word</span>, <span class="smcap">would a</span> &lsquo;<span
class="smcap">second Pentecost</span>&rsquo; <span
class="smcap">become</span>!</p>
<p>We do not here mean to dwell on the example shewn to the
Church by the accord in prayer, the many pleading, so
differently, and yet in harmony; we are writing now for
preachers, knowing that hundreds of workers will read every line
we write, and we are thus led to enquire further&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">How far
Peter&rsquo;s Sermon is like the sermons we preach</span>?</p>
<p>Some who have read it, as it is printed, have said, &ldquo;We
should not have invited such a preacher to our circuit:&rdquo;
but such people forget that the accompaniments of preaching
cannot be printed.&nbsp; Who can write down the spiritual
atmosphere?&nbsp; Who can reproduce the tone of voice in which
Peter spoke?&nbsp; How can he describe what some of us have
felt&mdash;the unction&mdash;the never-to-be-forgotten emotions
of the soul?&nbsp; Depend upon it, these were present in a
remarkable manner.</p>
<p>But beside all this, there are the Bible facts.&nbsp; Peter
knew his Bible and could quote it.&nbsp; How familiar he must
have been with the Old Testament!&nbsp; Could he have found, in
any part of the book, passages more telling and more <!-- page
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>suitable?&nbsp; If we knew our Bible better, we should
not need to do as the manner of some is, round off common-place
ideas of our own, with pretty poetry of someone else&rsquo;s!</p>
<p>Then, the preacher was not afraid to tell the congregation
what sins they had committed.&nbsp; Many of them were what is
called &ldquo;good sort of people, went to place of worship, and
paid their way,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; But it was true,
&ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God, ye have taken,
and by wicked hands have crucified and slain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us
who preach, cry to God to give us His Spirit, that we may tell
those who hear us of their sins.&nbsp; How are they to be
convinced of sins, if they are not told of them?</p>
<p>Nor was Peter satisfied with the good feeling, or even with
seeing the people moved.&nbsp; It was not enough for him that his
hearers were pricked in the heart, he would have them do
more.&nbsp; Would he not have said to many of those who have gone
into the inquiry-room, &ldquo;I am not satisfied that you are in
earnest.&nbsp; You want God to save you in your
sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Repentance is impossible to those who are not
conscious of guiltiness.&nbsp; And, without repentance, faith
holds the cup of water to one who was never thirsty.&nbsp; Do you
wonder that it is loathsome?&nbsp; He might drink if it were not
so pure,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">But it takes
thirst to relish water</span>!</p>
<p>This is a tempting subject, we could say much more, but we
will only add, that the last word in the chapter, which tells of
&ldquo;Peter the Preacher,&rdquo; gives the result of such
sermons as his&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Saved</span>!&rdquo;</p>

55</span>XXIV.&nbsp; &ldquo;WHEN SOLOMON WAS OLD.&rdquo;</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>It came to pass when Solomon was
old</i>, <i>that his wives turned away his heart after other
Gods</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xi. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who could have predicted that this would come to pass?&nbsp;
And yet it is often so, for it is still true that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">No amount of
Knowledge will Save from Backsliding those who Refuse to Listen
to God</span>.</p>
<p>We learn from verse 10 that God had taken pains to save
Solomon from idolatry, (see 1 Kings vi. 12, and xi. 6).&nbsp; But
what good is it for even God to try to save a man who will have
his own way?&nbsp; And yet one would have thought that a man who
knew what Solomon knew, would have not bowed down to gods of wood
and stone!&nbsp; It is not always at our weakest place we
fail!&nbsp; It is well for us to be aware of this.&nbsp; Who
would have expected Moses to fail in his temper, or Elijah in his
courage?&nbsp; Solomon must have hated himself when he bowed
before these graven images, and must have looked with loathing on
those filthy idols before whom he was prostrate, and yet he went
on in his evil way.&nbsp; How the priests who offered the
idolatrous sacrifices would rejoice in their illustrious
pervert!&nbsp; Will any of us ever give the foes of God cause for
exultation?&nbsp; Do not tell me that you are too well
instructed!&nbsp; Are you wiser than Solomon?&nbsp; &ldquo;Let
not the wise man glory in his wisdom.&nbsp; Let him that glorieth
glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth
Me.&rdquo;&mdash;Jer. ix, 23-24.&nbsp; You <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>are safe only
as you are willing to be led by the word of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">What is the
Bible to You</span>?</p>
<p>Is it a lamp to your feet?&nbsp; Not merely a lantern to keep
you out of the mire, but a treasure like that miner&rsquo;s lamp;
a light by which he is not only guided, but able to walk in the
shadow of death.&nbsp; All around him is the gas that would slay
him, and yet by that lamp he walks to the place of safety!&nbsp;
This is what the Bible must be to you, or it is nothing.</p>
<p>Mind you, it is not enough for you to know the Bible.&nbsp; We
have heard drunken men quote it with correctness, but it had not
saved them from the demon which haunted them.&nbsp; It is an
instructive thought that the man who wrote some of the Bible, who
is spoken of in the pulpit as &ldquo;The Wise Man,&rdquo; the
author of the Book of Proverbs, was led away into sin and eternal
disgrace.&nbsp; In fact, it matters not what we know, if we are
not led of the Spirit we shall come to grief.&nbsp; The more
deeply a ship is laden, if she gets aground, the more likely she
is to become a wreck.&nbsp; It takes the wisest of men to make
the fool Solomon became.&nbsp; Perhaps the most serious aspect of
this story is, that it was not while the king was young, but when
grey-headed, that he wandered from God, and this leads me to say
that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The worst cases
of Backsliding are among those who are no longer
young</span>.</p>
<p>We should not have been surprised if Solomon had been led away
by youthful passion or indiscretion, but we are shocked to find
that it was when he ought to have been venerable that he became
vicious&mdash;&ldquo;When Solomon was old.&rdquo;&nbsp; We should
have expected history would have told <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>us of the
power he exerted over the people; how the nation saw in his
silver locks the crown of glory he had spoken of in his
book.&nbsp; It would have seemed natural to have read of great
gatherings of the people of different nations, listening to his
wondrously wise words.&nbsp; Instead of this, the news spread far
and wide that the wise king had stooped to folly of the worst
degree.</p>
<p>My brothers! what sort of old men shall we make?&nbsp; If we
are allowed to remain among our fellows, shall we live the life
that shall make men thank God for our length of days, or will
they wish we had died in our youthful prime?&nbsp; There are men
whose youth was like the mountain stream, which cheered
everything it touched.&nbsp; Born among the mountains, and
wedding other brooks and streamlets, uniting them in a river,
clear and lovely, along whose banks children loved to play.&nbsp;
But later on, as it became broad and deep, taking in pollution
and garbage, until the clear and joyous river is changed into a
great sewer, filling the air with noxious smells, and defiling
the face of nature with its liquid blackness.&nbsp; Such is life
to some men&mdash;Solomon was one, perhaps the worst.</p>
<p>One is ready to ask&mdash;Can this be the man to whom God
spake in large promise?&nbsp; Is this he whose prayer brought
into the temple the manifested presence of the Almighty?&nbsp;
Can it be possible that this hoary idolater had been the
favourite of Jehovah?&nbsp; Alas! it is only too true.&nbsp; More
than once we have known men whose prayers could bring heaven to
earth, and lift earth to heaven, but who have lived too long, and
ere they fell into a dishonoured grave, brought shame to the
cross of Jesus, and gave the enemies of God food for
laughter.&nbsp; Let those among us who are no longer young, see
to it that we are not among those who <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>fall more
deeply into sin than it is possible for young disciples to
do.</p>
<p>What should we think if Westminster Abbey became a
gin-palace?&nbsp; If all around its gates lewd men and
dishonoured women stood and cracked their filthy jokes; if from
its lovely choir the drunkard&rsquo;s song was heard?&nbsp;
Verily, you say, &ldquo;It is nigh to blasphemy to imagine such a
thing.&nbsp; We had rather that it had been burned to ashes when
the fire of London destroyed St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Would that
it had reached far enough West to destroy the ancient pile rather
than it should be so polluted!&rdquo;&nbsp; Aye, aye, you are
right, and yet to see a man who, in his youth was a Christian,
but in his old age has become an apostate, is a more sorrowful
sight still.&nbsp; Alas! that it should be so common.</p>
<p>How did it come about?&nbsp; What scheme of hell led to
this?&nbsp; What combination of men and fiends accomplished this
tragedy?&nbsp; It was love&mdash;affection, infatuation, for that
which ought not to have been loved, &ldquo;King Solomon loved
many strange women, besides the daughter of Pharaoh,&rdquo; as
the margin puts it.&nbsp; And this leads me to say that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">A Man&rsquo;s
Female Friends Frame his Fortunes</span>.</p>
<p>Solomon began wrong; he allowed his affection to fasten itself
on a stranger&mdash;an Egyptian.&nbsp; It is a question worth
considering, whether we preachers say enough to the people on
this question of matrimony.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s marriage is sure
to tell on his history.&nbsp; He can never be the same again he
was before.&nbsp; He may wed one who shall help him to be good,
whose voice shall be like church bells calling him to
prayer.&nbsp; Or he may fasten himself to one, who, like Jezebel,
shall stir up her husband to deeds of shame and cruelty.&nbsp;
<!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Sometimes we have felt, when we have seen some
marriages, that it would have been a fitting thing if a hearse
had been among the carriages, for there lay <span
class="smcap">dead hope</span> on its way to a grave from which
there could be no resurrection!</p>
<p>Young man! what woman is it you like the best?&nbsp; Who is
her god?&nbsp; Fashion?&nbsp; Pleasure?&nbsp; What is the name of
the deity she worships?&nbsp; If it is anyone rather than
Jehovah, beware!&nbsp; Before you die, she shall turn you as
Solomon was turned.&nbsp; What is that you say?&nbsp; You are not
such a fool!&nbsp; Well, that remains to be seen.&nbsp; Are you
one of those who trust in his own heart?&nbsp; If so, remember
what he is called.&nbsp; See Prov. xxviii. 26.&nbsp; Is not the
helm of your life in her hands now?&nbsp; Would you love her as
you do, if she had not the reins of your soul in her grasp?&nbsp;
If Solomon had known all that was to follow when he first looked
on the daughter of Pharaoh, he would have died before he would
have made her his bride.&nbsp; Let not this sad story be in any
way a prophecy of your future.&nbsp; There are plenty of women
whom to know is to be elevated, and whom to wed would be to
foretaste the companionship of heaven.&nbsp; Wives are often the
architects and the husbands the builders.&nbsp; See to it, that
the woman you love does not make you lay out the foundation of a
jail.&nbsp; She may tell you it is a palace, but neither of you
have yet seen the elevation.&nbsp; She only draws the
ground-plan.</p>
<p>There is yet another scene in this tragedy.&nbsp; Solomon, by
his folly, lost his son&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; God said, &ldquo;I
will surely rend the kingdom from thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rehoboam was
the poorer for his father&rsquo;s sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Our Children
become the Heirs of our Crimes</span>.</p>
<p>Some other day, it may be, we will take the story of the <!--
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>son.&nbsp; Let it suffice to-day that we learn the
lesson the Bible would teach us.&nbsp; Solomon&rsquo;s sun went
down in a cloud.&nbsp; It is a disputed question whether Solomon
repented in time to save his soul.&nbsp; There ought to have been
no question as to whether he was in heaven or no.&nbsp; As it is,
we don&rsquo;t know that David has one of his children with him,
except the baby boy who died despite his father&rsquo;s fasting
and prayer.&nbsp; Surely no one more than David will need to have
that promise fulfilled&mdash;&ldquo;God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be that David has needed to
be comforted, because the builder of the temple is among those
who died in idolatry.</p>
<p>Let every father among us bear in mind, that when we neglect
prayer, or give up devotion, because we want the time for seeking
gold or any other idol, we are mortgaging our children&rsquo;s
future.&nbsp; Giving up religious exercises is like cutting down
the trees on an estate, the next heir will know the want of
them.&nbsp; No man can be said to be a good father, who, for the
sake of any worldly good, impoverishes the souls of his
offspring.&nbsp; &ldquo;Turned away his heart after other
gods,&rdquo; means turning away the kingdom of Israel.&nbsp; Sin
cannot be separated from sorrow, and this is as true to-day as it
was in the days of Solomon.</p>

<h3>1.&mdash;&ldquo;After these things.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>What things?&nbsp; See verse 33 in preceding chapter.&nbsp;
After Abraham had given himself to prayer.&nbsp; It often happens
that grace is given for grace.&nbsp; God prepares his own for
trial and suffering by revealing Himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God did
tempt</span>.&rdquo;&mdash;Like a workman who is conscious the
work is well done, fears not the scrutiny which waits his
labour.&nbsp; When the smith has put good work into the iron
cable, he does not then fear the strain of the test put upon it,
and God knew what He had done to Abraham in the grove at
Beersheba.&nbsp; If we have a Beersheba, we need not fear
Moriah.</p>
<h3>2.&mdash;&ldquo;Isaac, whom thou lovest.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>God has a right to the best.&nbsp; He does not ask us to do
what He has not done Himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;He gave his only
begotten Son.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>3.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rose up early.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Abraham was prompt.&nbsp; Where there is a task to be
performed, lose no time.&nbsp; Work does not grow easier by
delay.&nbsp; Do not fritter away strength in trifles; begin at
once upon the duties which call for instant obedience.&nbsp; We
do not read that Abraham asked Sarah&rsquo;s advice, the command
was plain.&nbsp; She might not have been willing.&nbsp; Never ask
advice from those whom God does not trust.</p>

act as brains in an empty skull.&nbsp; Get ready, then go.&nbsp;

on the altar.&nbsp; Whatever would interfere with prayer, when we
retire for that purpose, or with sacrifice, when we make the
effort, should be left behind.&nbsp; Leave hinderers with the
ass, they will be in congenial society!</p>

<p>Where is the lamb?&nbsp; Isaac&rsquo;s words would pierce his
father&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; How came it the young man
yielded?&nbsp; Was there a struggle?&nbsp; Did Abraham bind him
by force?&nbsp; There is no indication in the story of any
resistance.&nbsp; Do the words of Jesus cast any light,&nbsp;
&ldquo;Abraham saw My day, and was glad?&rdquo;&nbsp; Received
him in a figure&rdquo; (Heb. xi. 19.)&nbsp; Did father and son
see what was to occur in the distance?</p>
<h3>10.&mdash;&ldquo;Took the knife to slay his son.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>God tries us to the full.&nbsp; His tests are no shams.&nbsp;
Before the Hall-mark is put on the metal, the acid proves it

64</span>XXVI.&nbsp; OIL FOR LAMPS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> xxv. 1-13.</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s kingdom is imperfect as yet, for it is not said to
be like five, but ten virgins.&nbsp; It is worthy of our careful
thought that it is to be made perfect by contraction, not
expansion.&nbsp; The King is to say &ldquo;Depart!&rdquo; as well
as &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not attempt anything like exposition of this solemn and
yet charming parable, but rather to notice some of the most
easily perceived truths it discovers.</p>
<h3>I.&mdash;A Light is better than a Lamp.</h3>
<p>All the ten took their lamps.&nbsp; Very likely there was
variety in the shape and material of the lamp, but only five of
them had lamps that kept alight, for some of them had no means of
replenishment.&nbsp; For anything we know, the lamps of the
foolish were as good as the others, may-be better, but the flame
and not the frame is the important matter.&nbsp; We cannot have
the power without the form.&nbsp; Grace must have the human
material, but we may have the human without the Divine.&nbsp; Our
Bibles, our Prayers, our Hymns, all these are channels of grace,
as the lamp and the wick are essential to the flame, but the lamp
may not be lighted, or it may have gone out!&nbsp; It is not a
question of John Keble, or General Booth, but is the singing from
the heart?&nbsp; The &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; may be shouted or
intoned, but if not real, it is worse than smouldering wick.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;We may as well be without oil as not have enough to
endure to the end.</h3>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>All ten lamps were at one time burning.&nbsp; In the
margin of verse 10, we read, &ldquo;Our lamps are going
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a lesson to the backslider!&nbsp; You once
were a burning and a shining light, but you did not seek grace to
help in time of need, and your lamp is gone out.&nbsp; Better
never have made a profession if there be not grace to sustain the
flame.&nbsp; Aye, and perhaps you, with a lamp which has gone
out, you have been a preacher, or a teacher, and have, before
now, enforced this very lesson on your hearers.&nbsp; If there is
a sight in this world over which angels might weep, it is a
preacher without a light.&nbsp; Better go to hell from a
race-course than a pulpit!</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;The gates or the palace may be shut while we are
calling on the oil seller.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;While they went to buy, the Bridegroom
came.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is an old saying, that &ldquo;praying
breath was never wasted.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this parable does not
teach that lesson.&nbsp; There are not a few who think they can
atone for the sins of a long life by crying with their dying
breath, &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the truth
is, there may be the fear of punishment without any penitence,
and cries for dread of hell may not be the sacrifice of a broken
and a contrite heart.</p>
<p>Let us not put off our repentance too long, or while we are
sending for the minister to instruct us, death may claim us for
his prey.&nbsp; Or while we are saying to the teacher of
religion, &ldquo;What must I do to escape hell?&rdquo; the
fetters may be fastened on our soul.&nbsp; The palace-gate may
swing to before we can make the oil-man hear.</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;That which lets the five wise in to the palace,
keeps out the five foolish.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The door was shut.&rdquo;&nbsp; The five were in, and
then came the other five, to find the gate closed.&nbsp; Then
they begin to <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>cry &ldquo;Open to us!&rdquo; but in
vain.&nbsp; The door makes all the difference.&nbsp; If you
enter, it is by the door; if you are shut out, it is the door
that closes against you.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the door,&rdquo; said
Jesus, and it is yet true.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man cometh to the
Father but by Me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, Jesus is the True and Living
way, and the only one.&nbsp; But if we are lost, it will be the
aspect of Jesus which will slay our last hope.&nbsp; It is the
wrath of the Lamb which is so dreadful.&nbsp; Have you ever
thought of it, my brother, that Christ is to be Life or Death to
thee?&nbsp; If he does not shut thee into heaven, He will shut
thee out.&nbsp; Shall you ever be one of the group which cry, as
their last prayer, &ldquo;Lord!&nbsp; Lord! open to
us!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="smcap">John</span> viii. 7.</h2>
<p>Cast a stone at whom?&nbsp; At a woman!&nbsp; Why not at a
man?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">There was a
man</span>, <span class="smcap">why not stone him</span>?</p>
<p>Just so, but then the Scribes and Pharisees did not bring
him.&nbsp; It is so easy to punish the woman, and yet it is not
proved that she was worse than her paramour.&nbsp; But is it not
the way of the world to make the woman bear all the shame and all
the suffering?&nbsp; We say, &ldquo;She is a fallen woman;&rdquo;
and yet we speak of a man who breaks the seventh commandment as
one who is &ldquo;sowing his wild oats!&rdquo;&nbsp; Why is he
not called a fallen man?&nbsp; If a woman falls, we put her
outside our sympathies and our regard, and we may be right is so
doing.&nbsp; But at the same time we don&rsquo;t put the man
outside.&nbsp; He can come into our drawing-rooms.&nbsp; He may
dine at the same table with our daughters.&nbsp; If we saw them
speak to the woman, we should cry out with loathing, &ldquo;Come
away from her!&rdquo; but</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">we don&rsquo;t
cry out when they laugh at the jokes of a man who has
fallen</span>!</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast a stone at her!&rdquo;&nbsp; Who shall stone
her?&nbsp; &ldquo;He that is without sin, let him be the first to
pick up a stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, then, reader, why don&rsquo;t
you throw a stone?&nbsp; Nay, but I have no right, say you, I am
not without sin.&nbsp; Is this to be the rule, none are to punish
the fallen but those who have never tripped?&nbsp; Why, this
would silence many who <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>are very ready to speak against these
unhappy sisters.&nbsp; We make no apologies for the crimes of
those who have yielded to temptation, but we do ask, is there
room for our rebukes when we are not without sin?</p>
<p>Perhaps this book may be read by our sisters who have gone
astray.&nbsp; To such, we say, in the words of Jesus, (verse
11.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sin no
more</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are not obliged to do so.&nbsp; No one is.&nbsp; There is
always a way made for those who truly repent.&nbsp; Call upon
Jesus, the Friend of sinners, and He will open a door of hope for
you.&nbsp; To persevere in sin, is only to ruin soul and body
too.&nbsp; Perhaps you have parents living, who long to see you,
and who would be glad to take you to their hearts.&nbsp; Give
them the joy of having you near them once more.&nbsp; Is it not
in your power to answer their prayer&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">O

within call, and He has said, in His word, &ldquo;Come unto me
all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, there is the &ldquo;Father
of lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; He who tempted the first woman, and led her
astray, and taught her to lead the man wrong.&nbsp; This evil one
is whispering in your ear&mdash;&ldquo;There is no

69</span>XXVIII.&nbsp; &ldquo;OFFER IT NOW UNTO THY
GOVERNOR.&rdquo;<br />
<span class="smcap">Malachi</span> i. 8.</h2>
<p>We beg to suggest to those who want a new text that will
strike and stick, that they should look through <span
class="smcap">Malachi&rsquo;s</span><b> </b>book.&nbsp; There are
plenty of texts like splinters therein.&nbsp; The words that head
this article are part of an appeal to the people on the question
of right service.&nbsp; The prophet was indignant with his
country people, who wished to combine prayer with parsimony, and
worship with worldly policy.&nbsp; He complained that they dare
not offer to their superiors what they sent as a sacrifice to
God.&nbsp; Might not some Christians be asked the same
questions?&nbsp; Would the &ldquo;Governor&rdquo; accept the
present God was supposed to be glad to get?&nbsp; Who would think
of trying to get into the good graces of any one by sending a
spavined horse, or a cow with foot-and-mouth-disease, as a
present?</p>
<p>In the matter of prayer, for instance.&nbsp; Take a
congregation supposed to be asking God to pardon their sins, and
to give them all the blessings their souls and bodies need.&nbsp;
Mind you, they are people who say they believe that &ldquo;he
that believeth not is condemned&rdquo; already; that &ldquo;the
wages of sin is death,&rdquo; and yet, listen how they
pray!&nbsp; We will suppose the man in the pulpit is in earnest
and means all he says.&nbsp; Look around, what do you see?&nbsp;
Scores of people who dare not sit in the presence even of the
Squire, to say nothing of the Queen, but there they sit, as
though that was the proper position for prayer!&nbsp; One of them
is taking <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the pattern of a new dress, or the
trimming of a bonnet; while another is wondering, not whether
there will be an answer to the prayer, but whether the man who is
leading the worship will keep on much longer, and ask for
something else, for already he has been praying ten minutes!</p>
<p>Supposing a petition is to be drawn up to the Queen, asking
for a pardon for one of the family, who for his crime, is under
sentence of death; what thought would be given to it?&nbsp; Even
the very paper, pens, and ink, would have to be of the best
quality.&nbsp; But hear yonder father praying for his
children&rsquo;s conversion.&nbsp; His son is old enough to have
rejected the gospel, and is condemned already; but how listless
the prayer!&nbsp; &ldquo;Offer it to thy Governor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Would the Queen be expected to deign to notice such a
petition?&nbsp; Is it any wonder such prayers are unanswered?</p>
<p>Look into this vestry!&nbsp; There is a meeting for
prayer.&nbsp; It is held with great regularity, so that it is
well known that a number of persons meet at a certain hour to ask
blessings from One who has said &ldquo;Knock and the door shall
be opened.&rdquo;&nbsp; Considering that this is the case, one
would have expected the room would be too small; but no, there is
never a large meeting.&nbsp; You see it is only a
prayer-meeting.&nbsp; If the Rev. Timothy Flowerpot was going to
preach, there would be a crowd, for he is popular, and he says
things which are supposed to be very superior to the Bible;
besides his prayers are eloquent, very different to what are
usually sent to the throne of grace.&nbsp; He is very sensitive,
though, in the matter of congregations, he will not go a second
time where there is only a handful of people.&nbsp; His work is
to speak to large audiences, and he would be very much offended
if the vestry were prepared for his service.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;Offer it to thy Governor.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the
Reverend Gentleman would not accept the congregation that meets
for an audience with God, can it be expected that the Lord of
heaven will be well pleased with those who care not to come when
prayer is made?</p>
<p>We shall be glad if these plain words cause some of our
readers to look at the sacrifice before they offer it, and ask,
would this kind of thing be acceptable to man?&nbsp; If not good
enough for my equal, will my Superior look with favour on
it?&nbsp; Listen once more to the rough, but sensible words of
the Hebrew prophet:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">If ye

<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Preached at a Sunday School
Anniversary</i>.]</p>
<p>This is a children&rsquo;s question.&nbsp; God does not wish
the boy to be snubbed when he wants to know.&nbsp; There is a
kind of curiosity which is like the scent in a hound&mdash;a
Divine instinct&mdash;and must not be checked, for that is
waste.&nbsp; If you chill your child when he comes to ask, you
may break the link which binds him to you, and never be able to
weld it again.&nbsp; There will be a time come when you will long
to have the lad come to your side, but it will be too late.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When your children shall ask their fathers . . .&nbsp;
Then ye shall let your children know&rdquo; (21-22.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Obedience to
God&rsquo;s Commandments will cause our</span><b><br />
</b><span class="smcap">children to ask questions which will be

<p>This is very different to what is called &ldquo;questionable
conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want your son to say
&ldquo;I cannot understand how my father makes his ledger square
with the Bible;&rdquo; or the girl to say, &ldquo;How does mother
make this love of display harmonise with the
class-meeting?&rdquo;&nbsp; No, no! this is not it; but,
&ldquo;What mean these stones?&rdquo;&nbsp; As the little girl
said to her sister, &ldquo;What is it makes mother&rsquo;s face
shine so after she has been in her chamber so long?&rdquo;&nbsp;
That mother had been praying to her Father which seeth in secret,
and He had rewarded her openly.&nbsp; If we live lives of
cheerful obedience, the children will say, &ldquo;What is the
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Sacrament?&nbsp; What do you do at the Class-meeting?
&amp;c.&nbsp; Why cannot I go with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These stones are very suggestive.&nbsp; There are sermons in
them.&nbsp; Some lessons which will occur to every one; others
that need to be thought over again and again.&nbsp; For instance,
there are twelve,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">A stone for
each tribe</span>.</p>
<p>They all came out of the bed of Jordan, and yet, there are no
two alike!&nbsp; Judah&rsquo;s is not like Napthali&rsquo;s, and
yet both came from the same place, and are in the same
heap.&nbsp; We are not alike, though we be the children of the
same Father.&nbsp; You and I are very different, yet it is
&ldquo;Our Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yours as much as mine.&nbsp; John
Bunyan knew this, for he makes his pilgrim band to consist of
very great contrasts.&nbsp; Mr. Valiant for-the-truth, as well as
Mr. Despondency.&nbsp; And they all get across the stream.</p>
<p>It has been a favourite dream, in all ages, to have a church
of one pattern.&nbsp; Uniformity, that is, all of one
shape.&nbsp; God does not make the trees which bear the same kind
of fruit of one shape.&nbsp; You can make artificial flowers by
the shipload, all one tint, but the bees won&rsquo;t come round
your ship when you unload it!&nbsp; In a town where I have
preached many a time, there is a place of worship at each
end.&nbsp; As you come from the railway station, there is one
which begins the town&mdash;a Baptist Chapel, plain and
convenient, but right on the street, with the busy traffic all
round; while at the other end of the town there is a church with
a spire that makes you look up and think it is an anthem in
stone!&nbsp; All around are old-fashioned houses, with gardens
filled with flowers, and green lawns, while beyond there is a
real country lane, with May in the hedges, and the music of larks
and blackbirds.&nbsp; What a contrast!&nbsp; Yet if the ark of
God were <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>in danger, there would be brave
hearts come from both places to die for the truth.&nbsp; No! let
us have done with this wish to have all the same.&nbsp; It will
become monotony.&nbsp; Go down into the Jordan and fetch your
stone!&nbsp; Aye, aye, and one will pick the heaviest, one that
will make his knees totter; and another will choose the squarest,
and yet another the smoothest, but each man lays his in the heap,
and it is well done!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What mean these stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Why</span>,
<span class="smcap">that it is safe to go where the Ark
goes</span>.</p>
<p>That chest is the sign of God&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; There is
the blood on the mercy-seat, and there are the angels of gold
looking at that spot of blood.&nbsp; All the time the ark stood
still in the bed of the river, the people could pass in
safety.&nbsp; There are many Jordans for some of us to pass, but
we need not to fear if God is there.&nbsp; There is the Jordan of
<span class="smcap">Poverty</span>.&nbsp; It is a deep stream,
and the water runs fast: yes, but if the ark goes first, thou
shalt not be overcome.&nbsp; Does Providence call on thee to go
down in the world?&nbsp; Never fear! the Ark is there.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will never leave thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are thinking now
of a friend of ours, not sainted, but saintly, who has seen great
reverses of fortune, yet her life has been a psalm.&nbsp; She
reminds me of a robin, for, like him, her song has been sweeter
than ever in the dark days.&nbsp; You may have to cross the river
of <span class="smcap">Persecution</span>, but the Ark is
there.&nbsp; When the three brave men preferred the furnace to
idolatry, they found the Son of Man in the flames waiting for
them, and so shall you.</p>
<p>And when it comes to the Jordan of <span
class="smcap">Death</span>, we shall know the Ark has gone on
before.&nbsp; Some of you lame ones will step it out bravely when
you see the Ark.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember, that good old
&ldquo;Ready to Halt&rdquo; left his crutches <!-- page 75--><a

bank?&nbsp; It was because he could see the Ark in the bed of the
river.</p>
<p>Do not these stones teach that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">God honours
faith</span>?</p>
<p>Brave Levites!&nbsp; Who can help admiring them, to carry that
Ark right into the stream; for the waters were not divided till
their feet dipped in the water (ver. 15.)&nbsp; God had not
promised aught else.&nbsp; This is what is needed&mdash;what
Jabez Bunting was wont to call &ldquo;Obstinate faith,&rdquo;
that the <span class="smcap">promise</span> sees and &ldquo;looks
to that alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; You can fancy how the people would
watch these holy men march on, and some of the by-standers would
be saying, &ldquo;You would not catch me running the risk.&nbsp;
Why, man, the ark will be carried away?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not so,
&ldquo;the priests stood firm on dry ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must not overlook the fact that Faith on our part helps God
to carry out His plans.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come up to the help of the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Ark had staves for the shoulders.&nbsp;
Even the Ark did not move of itself, it was carried.&nbsp; When
God is the architect, men are the masons and labourers.&nbsp;
Faith assists God.&nbsp; It can stop the mouth of lions and
quench the violence of fire.&nbsp; It yet honours God, and God
honours it.&nbsp; O for this faith that will go on, leaving God
to fulfil His promise when He sees fit!&nbsp; Fellow-Levites, let
us shoulder our load, and do not let us look as if we were
carrying God&rsquo;s coffin.&nbsp; It is the Ark of the living
God.&nbsp; Sing as you march towards the flood.</p>
<p>These stones we can see, remind us of other stones we cannot
see (verse 9.)&nbsp; &ldquo;And Joshua set up twelve stones in
the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests
which bare the Ark of the Covenant stood, and they are there unto
this day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Will these stones ever be found?&nbsp;
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

serve us as a lesson.&nbsp; There are things unseen as real as
things we look on every day.</p>

<p>What do you call that piece of wood there?&nbsp; Why, the
communion rail, to be sure.&nbsp; Communion? what does that
mean?&nbsp; It is only a piece of wood, and yet it makes us think
of Him Who, the same night that He was betrayed, took bread,
saying, &ldquo;Do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Kneeling at that rail, we may, by faith, take hold of the Man who
died for us.&nbsp; Rightly used, the Lord&rsquo;s Supper may be
manna&mdash;angels&rsquo; food.</p>
<p>What is this day?&nbsp; The Sabbath.&nbsp; The Rest Day.&nbsp;
The toils of life are o&rsquo;er for a little time.&nbsp; Ah!
this is another of the stones we see, which tell of stones we
cannot see.&nbsp; There is a Sabbath that has no week-day; there
is a world where there is no toil, no anxiety, no tears!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O, long expected day begin!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you call that sweet noise?&nbsp; Music?&nbsp; And what
is that but another of these stones we can see, which tell of
others we see not as yet.&nbsp; Dr. Watts said of sacred
music&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus, Lord, while we remember Thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We, blest and pious grow;<br />
By hymns of praise we learn to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Triumphant here below.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I hear those children&rsquo;s voices I seem to catch the
sweeter strains of my children in heaven, singing their
joy.&nbsp; Those deep, manly bass voices remind me of the psalms
up yonder&mdash;like the sound of many waters.&nbsp; Why, the
very crape some of you wear reminds me of some who sat by your
side, and who are now clad in garments &ldquo;whiter than
snow.&rdquo;</p>

which head this form a picture.&nbsp; It is harvest-time, and the
old folks have been depending on their able-bodied son getting in
all their corn, but they are doomed to disappointment.&nbsp; He
sleeps when he should work.&nbsp; When others are toiling he is
snoring, and his corn rots in the field because he does not carry
it while he has fine weather.&nbsp; How ashamed his father
is!&nbsp; Other men have got their corn well housed, but his is
still where it grew, because the son he has reared is lazy and
self-indulgent.&nbsp; One feels that no language is too strong
for this indolent young man.</p>
<p>But what has this to do with us? some will ask.&nbsp; We
reply&mdash;Is not this the harvest time of the church, when the
days are closing and the nights lengthening?&nbsp; Have we not
been used to hear of special efforts being made for the rescue of
perishing souls, and ingathering of those who are in danger of
dying unready?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Are you Asleep
in Harvest</span>?</p>
<p>Let every Methodist who reads this ask&mdash;What am I
doing?&nbsp; Am I sleeping or harvesting?&nbsp; What am I doing
to gather in the ripe corn?&nbsp; If I am indolent I shall cause
shame to the people who count me one of themselves.&nbsp; If <!--
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>we sleep now that we should work, at the March Quarterly
Meeting our place will be down in numbers, and as there are
others of the same indolent sort, our circuit will be down at the
District Meeting, and perhaps the District be down, and there
will be the shame among the churches if Methodism is down.</p>
<p>Other churches are used to look to us to shew them how to do
the reaping.&nbsp; O, let us be up and doing!&nbsp; How shall we
dare to meet our Lord if we sleep when we should sweat?&nbsp; How
shall we bear it, if the members of other religious societies
tell us that our bad example corrupted them?&nbsp; What will be
our shame, if we find that those who expected us to gather them
in accuse us of slothfulness, and destroying their souls by our
neglect?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Can we expect
to keep our Children</span>, <span class="smcap">if they
see</span><br />
<span class="smcap">our Farm pointed out as the Field
of</span><br />
<span class="smcap">the Sluggard</span>?</p>
<p>Will not very shame drive them from their own home to find one
among those whom we once taught the way to reap?</p>
<p>We wish that we could do with all drowsy Methodists what
Jonah&rsquo;s captain did with him.&nbsp; We should dearly like
to give them a good shake and say, &ldquo;Awake, O
sleeper!&rdquo;&nbsp; We think of towns and villages, where, not
very long ago, there was the song of the reaper, but now, alas!
he has gone fast asleep.&nbsp; Shame will be the inheritance of
those who are drowsy when they ought to be at work.&nbsp; Why
have contempt poured on thee, when glory is to be won by
work?&nbsp; Grasp the sickle and go out among the standing corn,
or the rust on thy reaping hook shall eat into thy soul for
ever!</p>

ROOT.&rdquo;</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>And now also the axe is laid unto the
root of the trees</i>.&nbsp; <i>Therefore</i>, <i>every tree
which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into
the fire</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want to preach, it will be wise for us to study the
examples of preaching given in the Bible.&nbsp; John was filled
with the Holy Ghost, and therefore taught of God: and it is easy
to see that the man&rsquo;s nature was allowed full play.&nbsp;
The Holy Ghost does not destroy character, but uses it, and these
words of the Baptist are natural to him.&nbsp; Rugged strength is
in every figure of the speech he uses.&nbsp; But I am not
preaching to preachers, but to sinners, as John was, and in using
the great Baptist&rsquo;s words, I would have you to visit</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The
Devil&rsquo;s Orchard</span>.</p>
<p>This is not the only time in the Bible when wicked men are
compared to trees.&nbsp; There is a notable example in
Nebuchadnezzar, who, in his dream, saw a tree great and high, and
saw an angel come down from heaven, look at it and then cry
out&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hew down
the Tree</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in his case it was not said, &ldquo;Cast it into the
fire,&rdquo; but leave the stump with a band of iron and
brass.&nbsp; You will remember this dream was fulfilled, and the
king of Babylon lost his reason, and became like a beast, but the
tree was allowed to grow again.&nbsp; Not so with these: John is
speaking about the trees to be burned.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>But we may be asked&mdash;What are the trees in the
devil&rsquo;s orchard?&nbsp; They are men and women whose lives
are wrong.&nbsp; You may see what Paul says in the letter he
wrote to the Christians in Galatia&mdash;Adultery, Fornication,
Uncleanness, Lasciviousness, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred,
Variance, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Heresies, Envying, Murders,
Drunkenness, Revellings, and such like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Now</span>,
<span class="smcap">does this list include you</span>?</p>
<p>Well, you say, I am not a murderer.&nbsp; But are you
envious?&nbsp; Do you grieve because someone more worthy than you
is enjoying something you would like?&nbsp; Do you not see that
is like what the devil felt when he saw Adam in Paradise?&nbsp;
You can, by envy, soon become a destroyer.&nbsp; You say you are
not an Adulterer, but are you lascivious?&nbsp; Do you like to
think of unclean things?&nbsp; Do you delight in filthy pictures
or &ldquo;bawdy&rdquo; songs?&nbsp; If so, you are fitting
yourself for the fire where the Sodomites are.&nbsp; You say you
are not as bad as some; perhaps you have not been growing as long
as they have.&nbsp; Hatred and Variance are the trees on which
the devil grafts Murders.&nbsp; Do you notice the last words in
that sentence of Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And such
like</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If not a Drunkard or a Reveller, yet going in that direction;
having a liking for evil companions and Sunday pleasuring.&nbsp;
Am I looking on some of the saplings which Satan means to graft
before next year?&nbsp; Christmas and New Year will soon be
here.&nbsp; The dance and the ball-room are the places where</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Revellers
become Fornicators and Adulterers</span>!</p>
<p>Are you a tree in the devil&rsquo;s orchard?&nbsp; If so, you
may see your future in the words &ldquo;Cast into the
fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>In the crowds of people who listened to John, there were
numbers of religious folk.&nbsp; Some of them were
teachers.&nbsp; All the devil&rsquo;s trees don&rsquo;t grow on
his estate, therefore I want you now to look at</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The
Devil&rsquo;s Trees which Grow in God&rsquo;s Orchard</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Judas</span> was one.&nbsp; He had the
advantage of Christ&rsquo;s friendship, and might have become one
of the first missionaries, but he was covetous.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Demas</span> was the companion of <span

class="smcap">Sapphira</span> were growing side by side among the
beautiful trees in the early church, but they were selfish and
deceitful, and after telling a lie, they were both cut down and
cast into the fire.&nbsp; You notice it does not say every tree
in the devil&rsquo;s orchard shall be cut down, but &ldquo;every
tree which bringeth not forth good fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp; How is it
with you?&nbsp; Judgment has begun at the house of God.&nbsp;
What are you?&nbsp; What is the product of your life?&nbsp; Is
your influence beneficial?&nbsp; Does the result of your life
shew that you are born of God?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">A Holy Life is
the only way to Escape</span><br />
<span class="smcap">the Fire of Hell</span>.</p>
<p>Do not say you do no harm; that is not enough, you are to bear
fruit unto holiness.&nbsp; Your life must be profitable to God,
or you cannot escape the axe.&nbsp; A man does not plant apple
trees to look at, but to gather fruit from.&nbsp; Have you paid
God for all He has expended on you?&nbsp; Remember you are
British, you live where there are Bibles, Ministers, Sunday
Schools.&nbsp; Public opinion is on the side of right.&nbsp; It
is easier to be good here than anywhere else in the world.&nbsp;
The husbandman will not be satisfied with leaves or blossoms,
there must be</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Fruit or
Fire</span>!</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>&ldquo;The axe is laid to the root of
the trees.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you will do well to consider that there is a power of
destruction which may be called into action any moment.</p>
<p>Look, then, at</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s
Woodman</span>.</p>
<p>It is his duty to remove the trees when the time comes.&nbsp;
Mark you, he does not cut all down.&nbsp; The trees which bear
good fruit he transplants to grow for ever in <span
class="smcap">the Paradise of God</span>.&nbsp; Yes, death
differs in his action, and those of us who live a holy life need
not to dread him.&nbsp; He is rough, but he means well by us, and
though we may feel it when he pulls us up by the roots, it is to
grow in better soil, and under fairer skies.</p>
<p>You, though, who bear evil fruit, <span class="smcap">you do
well to fear death</span>.&nbsp; Keep good friends with the
doctor, so that you may have no difficulty in getting him day or
night, but remember that he is useless when the woodman aims a
blow at the root.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">the Wisest and
most Skilful of Medical Men</span><br />
<span class="smcap">cannot take the Axe out of Death&rsquo;s
Hand</span>!</p>
<p>There will be no escape when the woodman gets his
orders.&nbsp; Mark you, the axe is at the root this time.&nbsp;
He has lopped off some of the branches.&nbsp; I see in the
graveyard, headstones with names of infants low down, and space
left for the father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s names.&nbsp; Yes,
he will come for you next.&nbsp; What will you do then?&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">The tree is helpless</span>, <span
class="smcap">it cannot get away from the axe</span>!&nbsp; Blow
upon blow descends, there is no help for it, and so it will be
with you.&nbsp; What is it that your heart says,&mdash;&ldquo;I
will send for praying people?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, and if they come,
what then?&nbsp; Perhaps God will hear, and say to the woodman,
&ldquo;Put up thy axe for another year or two.&nbsp; Let us see
if he will keep <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>his word and bear fruit.&rdquo;&nbsp;
One wonders at the forbearance of God!&nbsp; There are some in
this place, who, when in affliction, sent for the godly, and
promised if only they were spared, they would bear good
fruit.&nbsp; But alas! they are worse than ever now.&nbsp; Let
such hardened sinners remember where the axe lies.&nbsp; The
woodman can pick it up any moment, and it will be useless to pray
then.&nbsp; Can you not hear the step of the feller of
trees?&nbsp; He is on his way with orders which brook no delay,
thy hour is at hand, and thou shalt fall, to be cast into the
fire!</p>
<p>I look around, and ask the question&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Who
among us shall dwell with the devouring</span><br />
<span class="smcap">fire</span>?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Who
among us shall dwell with</span><br />
<span class="smcap">everlasting burnings</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dare you look at the fire?&nbsp; Come, be a man, and see thy
future.&nbsp; The tree is in the blazing pit.&nbsp; It cannot get
out of the fire, any more than it could escape the axe.&nbsp; Did
you ever think of the illustration of the text&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Wood to
Fire</span>.</p>
<p>What more natural?&nbsp; It is true, it might have been
somewhere else, but it will burn as though it were made for the
fire.&nbsp; Mark you, it is unquenchable!&nbsp; Who can
extinguish that which God lights?&nbsp; You hear men say,
&ldquo;God is too good to burn men in hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is
not the way to put it.&nbsp; The fire will go out when there is
no fuel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Men who
sin</span>, <span class="smcap">burn themselves</span>.</p>
<p>That drunkard, for instance.&nbsp; They say of him, &ldquo;He
has a spark in his inside.&rdquo;&nbsp; What the poor wretch
suffers when he cannot get strong drink!&nbsp; How he begs and
prays for a penny to get a gill of beer.&nbsp; Now don&rsquo;t
blame God for that!&nbsp; It is his own doing.&nbsp; Suppose now,
God lets that man have <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>his own way, and die a drunkard, and
he wakes up in hell with that thirst, and no drink, not a drop,
and never will be!&nbsp; And is the drunkard the worst of
men?&nbsp; Is he worse than the man who grows rich on the other
man&rsquo;s poverty?&nbsp; I would as soon have the
drunkard&rsquo;s hell, as the eternity of those who took his
money, and sold him that which is burning away his life and
chances of salvation.&nbsp; Do you see that wicked seducer, and
those who dishonour their parents; and those who keep back that
which they have in plenty, when they might feed the hungry and
clothe the naked?&nbsp; &ldquo;These shall go away into
everlasting punishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now what are you going to
do?&nbsp; It is not the axe which is touching you now.&nbsp; It
is the hand of Jesus, the hand which has been scorched with the
fire of God&rsquo;s anger to save us.&nbsp; Christ suffered (the
just for the unjust) to bring us to God.&nbsp; Do not tire Him
out, for if he calls for the axe, there is no hope.&nbsp; Justice
may call, and when the woodman answers and takes up his axe,
prayer may cause the axe to fall from his hand; but when Mercy
says, &ldquo;Cut it down,&rdquo; all the men in the world may
cry, but nothing can save him from the fire.</p>

85</span>XXXII.&nbsp; JESUS AT THE WELL.<br />
A WORD TO PREACHERS.</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ travelled three years in a very poor
circuit.&nbsp; There were no stewards to provide for His wants,
and at times, we are told, He had not where to lay His
head.&nbsp; But all the three years He was a perfect example to
us, whether we are Locals or Itinerants, and, perhaps, never more
than when talking to the woman at the well of Samaria.&nbsp; From
His conduct there we may learn&mdash;</p>
<h3>I.&mdash;Never be daunted by a small congregation.</h3>
<p>It is very nice to have a crowd, but then that is not the lot
of us all, and we must not keep our best sermons for large
audiences.&nbsp; It may be that the few are able to appreciate
our best efforts.&nbsp; Jesus Christ said some of His best things
to individuals.&nbsp; John iii. 16 was not said to a crowd, but
to one.&nbsp; Indeed, if we were to take out of the gospels what
Jesus said to small audiences, we should rob them of their
choicest portions.&nbsp; So, if, when we get to the chapel we
find that there are more pews than people, let us preach to those
who are there.&nbsp; Why grumble at the few who have come,
perhaps a long way?&nbsp; Let us feed these with the choicest of
the wheat.&nbsp; It may be an historic time for anything you
know.&nbsp; There may be someone there whom your sermon may lead
to Jesus, and who himself may become a preacher.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;Interest your Audience.</h3>
<p>How skilfully Jesus went to work to lay hold of this <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>giddy
woman!&nbsp; He spoke of what to a native of the East must have
been a surprise, and a delightful idea.&nbsp; He goes on to tell
of being delivered from that plague of those hot climates,
thirst, and excites her wonder by speaking of a well of water
springing up in a man!</p>
<p>To our younger brethren, let us say that it is not easy to
succeed if we do not make what we say interesting.&nbsp; We do
not love sensationalism, but we do love savouryness.&nbsp; Let
all your sermons be seasoned with salt.&nbsp; Not a few of us
fail because we forget to make what we say savoury.&nbsp; Let us
excite the imagination of those who listen to us, and then we may
pour into the attentive ear that which will be of solid
benefit.&nbsp; How shopkeepers strive to strike the eye of the
passengers by skilfully dressing their windows, so as to catch
the attention!&nbsp; Shall it be said that they take more pains
to sell their goods than we do to get the gospel into the hearts
of our hearers!</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Make your hearers conscious of the
supernatural.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;I perceive thou art
a prophet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And this we can all do.&nbsp; We can
every one be on such terms with heaven as to make those who
listen to us know that we hold commerce with the skies.&nbsp; We
may not be eloquent or learned, but we may be prayerful and
impassioned.&nbsp; Preaching is unlike all other kinds of
speaking.&nbsp; We have no business in the pulpit except when
under the direct influence of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; We knew a man
who, for some years of his ministry, was dull and unpractical,
but there came upon him a baptism of power, and then we heard his
preaching described as &ldquo;white heat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should
not this be in every one of us?&nbsp; It is not possible for us
to be alike, nor is it desirable, but we may all make <!-- page
87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>our
hearers say, &ldquo;This man comes from God.&nbsp; His prayers
and his preaching convince us that he is owned by the God of
Elijah.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;Set your converts to work.</h3>
<p>We read &ldquo;The woman then left her waterpot, and went into
the city,&rdquo; and soon there was a crowd round the
Saviour.&nbsp; It is not said that Jesus told her to do so, but
she had heard words that were like fire in her bones.&nbsp; She
had been convinced of sin, and knew that God had spoken to
her.&nbsp; Is not this the way to fill our chapels?&nbsp; Say
things that wake up the conscience, and alarm the sinner, and he
must tell about it.&nbsp; Or shew the cross so plainly that the
anxious one finds the Lord, and is able to rejoice, and very soon
there will be an unpaid agency at work.&nbsp; Of course it will
not obtain to the same extent in every case.&nbsp; We are among
those who have to mourn that our preaching is not as effective as
it ought to be, but we are taking our own physic, and can testify
that since we have acted on the lines we have laid down, God has
been pleased to give us greater power over our congregations, and
we have seen greater results follow the preaching, poor as it
is.</p>

88</span>XXXIII.&nbsp; ANSWERED PRAYER.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>And the Lord heard the voice of
Elijah</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xvii.
22.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and He will hear your voice if you are as much in earnest
as he was!&nbsp; Why should not God hear the voice of William, or
Robert, Sarah or Edith?&nbsp; He is no respecter of
persons.&nbsp; Is it not written over the door of mercy,
&ldquo;Knock, and it shall be opened?&rdquo;&nbsp; Aye, and the
knocker is so low a child&rsquo;s hand may reach it.&nbsp; St.
James tells us that Elijah was &ldquo;a man of like
passions.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a human being like you and me, but
he had faith in God.&nbsp; Why should we not believe in God as
much as the prophet did?&nbsp; Is He not God yet?&nbsp; Have any
of these sceptics removed Him from His throne?&nbsp; If He is
still there, let us come with boldness as Elijah did.</p>
<p>This was not the first time God had heard the voice of His
servant, and answered his prayer, and there is no reason why we
should not have repeated and continuous replies in answer to our
requests.&nbsp; Had Elijah the same wealth of promise we
have?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> has spoken
since those times, and has said things which ought to fill us
with hopefulness whenever we pray.&nbsp; What wonderful words of
cheer He said in those last few days of His life, such as
&ldquo;Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be
full.&rdquo;&nbsp; Look up the references to that verse, and you
will feel you must kneel down and ask for something.</p>
<p>But is there not suggested by that word &ldquo;Ask,&rdquo; the
secret of so much failure?&nbsp; Do we ask?&nbsp; How often, in
what is called prayer, there is little or no supplication?&nbsp;
We <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>are to make our requests known.&nbsp; Listen to Elijah:
&ldquo;Lord, let this child&rsquo;s soul come into him
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should we not pray in the same direct
style?&nbsp; Our prayers would not weary others by their length,
if, before we knelt down, we thought</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">What is
needed</span>, <span class="smcap">and needed now</span>.</p>
<p>What a scene when the child began to breathe again! and when
the anxious mother was summoned to receive her boy from the
dead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I know thou art a
man of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is
truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the church fights its battles on its
knees, it prevails.&nbsp; Only let us, who say we believe in God,
put our faith into petition, and obtain answers, then Infidelity
will hide its head.&nbsp; Mr. Finney tells that when he first
began to attend a place of worship, it was as an honest inquirer
after truth.&nbsp; The members of the church noticed his coming
to the prayer meetings with regularity, and presently it occurred
to them that the young man might be anxious about his soul.&nbsp;
Accordingly they asked him if he would like them to pray for
him.&nbsp; He somewhat roughly declined, for, said he, &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t get any answers to your prayers for yourselves.&nbsp;
You have been for months praying to be revived, and you are not
any better.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps he was right, though rude.&nbsp;
We may have in our midst those who would believe the Bible if
they saw that we had only to ask to receive.</p>
<p>Let every father bear this in mind when he leads the devotions
of his family.&nbsp; Nothing is so likely to save our children
from infidelity as their knowing that we receive when we ask, and
that our knock brings an open door.&nbsp; If only the family
altar were the meeting place between God and man, Atheists might
sneer and chatter, but they would <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>never be able
to cause our children to listen, for would not they say, &ldquo;I
know my father is a man of God, and the word of the Lord in his
mouth is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reader, is the family altar at your house a bridge from earth
to heaven, or is it a sham, and a helper to those who say, Prayer
is an exploded superstition?</p>
<h3>PREACH REPENTANCE.</h3>
<p>Is there any truth in the allegation that we do not preach
Repentance as much as we ought to do?&nbsp; There is a soft sort
of preaching abroad which we Methodists should abhor, namely, a
gospel which has no dread of hell in it.&nbsp; We do not say that
we should spend much time in proving the eternity of punishment,
but certainly the thought of the fate of the impenitent should be
in solution in the preacher&rsquo;s mind, and then, like the
bitter herbs eaten with the Paschal Lamb, penitence will make the
gospel relishing.&nbsp; We have little doubt that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The doctrine of
the cross is and must be</span>, <span class="smcap">tasteless to
those who do not sorrow for sin</span>.</p>
<p>Those who preach repentance are in good company.&nbsp; He who
fails here does not tread in the steps of Jesus, who said,
&ldquo;Repent ye, and believe the gospel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is human
nature any better now than it was then, that we should cease to
say to the people what Christ said?&nbsp; Depend upon it, He knew
what to preach.&nbsp; None of the New Testament preachers said as
much about hell as He did, and yet, forsooth! we are told that
such preaching is coarse, and behind the age.&nbsp; When the age
is astray, the farther we are behind it the better for us.&nbsp;
It is sickening to hear men talk as though they were more refined
than was the Son of God!&nbsp; Such preaching is like raking the
garden with the teeth upwards.&nbsp; You may as well have no rake
at all, if you do not use the teeth.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>So David prevailed over the
Philistine</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Samuel</span>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, he did, but he would not have done so if he had remained
as quiet as the other Israelites.&nbsp; David was one of those
who could not be easy so long as the enemies of his country were
in the ascendant.&nbsp; To see a Philistine strutting about,
defying the armies of the living God, was more than he could
bear.&nbsp; Is not this the spirit which should animate
Christians to-day?&nbsp; It is not one <span

class="smcap">Profanity</span>, <span

only defying us, but destroying us.&nbsp; Is it not true that the
armies of the alien are robbing our families and churches,
plundering us of the results of years of toil?&nbsp; Think, in
one department alone, how we are spoiled.&nbsp; We refer to the
Sabbath school.&nbsp; What a small percentage of those who pass
through our schools become stable members of the church!&nbsp;
What crowds of our children become the slaves of sin!&nbsp; How
long do we mean to bear it?&nbsp; When shall we, like David, say,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Thy servant will go and fight with
this Philistine</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We read that &ldquo;David hasted, and ran towards the army to
meet the Philistine.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was aggressive.&nbsp; There
is a great deal to be said in favour of what is called
&ldquo;working on the old lines,&rdquo; but</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">David despised
the old lines</span>.</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>His countrymen had remained too long there; he would
dare and do, therefore ran into the lines of the
Philistines.&nbsp; Is it not too true that we stay in our
entrenchments too long?&nbsp; Why should we not carry the war
into the enemy&rsquo;s country?&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Wesley</span> and his fellow-labourers would not
have had the success they had, if they had not, like David, run
towards the enemy.&nbsp; It was time, for the sake of his
country&rsquo;s prestige, that he ran with his face towards the
foe.&nbsp; Shall we not imitate him, and dare something for
God?&nbsp; Saul&rsquo;s army had too often showed their backs to
the enemy.&nbsp; When a man runs towards his foe, he looks bigger
every stride, while if he runs away, he looks less, and becomes
more contemptible the more active he is!</p>
<p>David prevailed over the Philistine with very simple weapons,
but</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">they were his
own</span>.</p>
<p>If he had gone in Saul&rsquo;s armour, he might have
perished.&nbsp; He was no match for the giant if it came to a
sword fight.&nbsp; The long reach of the giant&rsquo;s arm would
have ended the conflict very soon.&nbsp; On the contrary, the
sling gave David an immense advantage.&nbsp; He could strike a
blow, and be out of Goliath&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp; Have we not
known some men more mighty, and more often victorious when they
were plain and unlettered, than they were after years of
culture?&nbsp; How is it?&nbsp; Perhaps because they, knowing
their ignorance, were more earnest in prayer.&nbsp; We know that
some of us feel, when we have preached;&mdash;That was a good
sermon, the arguments were irresistible, the illustrations were
beautiful, and so the people ought to have yielded, but they did
not!&nbsp; Did they?</p>
<p>If the pictures of this event we often see are to describe the
future of Christianity, we shall have to be as daring as <!--
page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>though God did not fight the battle, and as trustful as
though we had never driven the alien army back.&nbsp; When <span
class="smcap">Courage</span> is united to <span
class="smcap">Humility</span>, the Philistine may get measured
for his coffin (leaving out the head), and the damsels of Israel
have their timbrels tuned, for there will be a procession goodly
to look upon!</p>
<h3>BURNING THE BOOKS AT EPHESUS.</h3>
<p>This was one of the results of faithful preaching.&nbsp; Paul
had declared the whole counsel of God, both in powerful addresses
and in visiting from door to door.&nbsp; Miracles were wrought,
but what seems to have impressed the writer of this account most
of all, was not the healing of the sick, or the casting out of
devils, but men parting with that which was worth so much
money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">They brought their books
together</span>, <span class="smcap">and burned them before all
men</span>; <span class="smcap">and they counted the price of
them</span>, <span class="smcap">and found it fifty thousand
pieces of silver</span>.</p>
<p>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Has our religion been costly to us?&nbsp; Have we given up
anything?&nbsp; These converts gave up their money-making sins
publicly; and their public and costly repentance was made a great
blessing.&nbsp; We wish every Christian who is engaged in any
business that has made money for him at the expense of
another&rsquo;s morals, would see it his duty to make a bonfire
of it!&nbsp; We have no doubt there are numbers of Christians
whose consciences now and then give them a goutlike twinge.&nbsp;
We do not doubt their religion because they do not obey their
consciences; but we do say the word of God cannot grow mightily,
it is stunted, and in consequence they are religious dwarfs, when
they might have been giants in righteousness and holy
influence.</p>

94</span>XXXV.&nbsp; THE WAY TO PREACH TO THOSE WHO SLEEP IN
SIN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Nathan said to David</i>, <i>Thou art
the Man</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this was not the first thing he said.&nbsp; He approached
the subject very carefully.&nbsp; David would not have allowed
anyone to bring that subject home to him without resenting
it.&nbsp; It is more than likely that very few were in the
secret.&nbsp; Crafty Joab was not the man to let that story get
out.&nbsp; It gave him power over the king all the time it was
his secret, so that he could put pressure on David whenever he
liked.&nbsp; We read, &ldquo;The Lord sent Nathan unto
David.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we would know how to deal with our
congregations, we must have the Lord&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Men may be on
the Circuit Plan</span>, <span class="smcap">and God leave them
without appointments</span>!</p>
<p>Let us never set off to preach without a message from God to
the people, then we shall make folks say, what a plain Yorkshire
Methodist said of Stoner, &ldquo;Yon David&rsquo;s varry thick
with the Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the Lord send us, He will teach us how to talk, and most
likely He will take us off the pulpit track.&nbsp; Some of us
have given up the old &ldquo;three-decker&rdquo; style of
preaching, feeling that it is as useless as last year&rsquo;s
almanack.&nbsp; Our hearers often knew what was coming, they
heard the heads of the discourse, and began to see the end before
we got there, wrapping themselves in a habit of indifference
which <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>shielded them from the convictions we
had hoped to produce.&nbsp; What &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Californian Taylor</span>&rdquo; calls
&ldquo;Surprise Power,&rdquo; ought to be in every
discourse.&nbsp; David had no idea what the prophet meant to do
before he had ended his story, and we should wait upon God until
He has given us, not only the subject of our sermons, but the
skill we need to <span class="smcap">take the sinner either by
storm or holy subtilty</span>.</p>
<p>The charming story with which Nathan began his address is
instructive to those who wish to succeed as preachers.&nbsp; How
interested the King became as he heard of the rich man&rsquo;s
greed and the poor man&rsquo;s loss, until he was so stirred that
he threatened the death of the tyrant!&nbsp; May not we preachers
learn something here, that is, to interest our hearers, in order
that we may profit them?&nbsp; Do we sufficiently care for this
matter?&nbsp; Would it not be well, in the preparation of our
addresses and sermons, to make sure that we are so interesting
that our hearers cannot fail but listen?&nbsp; We should not be
content with soundness of faith, or truthfulness of doctrine, but
be so interesting as to command the attention of our
audience.&nbsp; It is a question whether any man, who cannot make
the people listen, should not be content to take his place in a
pew.&nbsp; It is better to be able to heat or light the chapel
well, than to wear out the patience of a congregation by prosy
preaching, and it will be more to our eternal advantage to have
been <span class="smcap">an industrious chapel-keeper than a dull
preacher</span>!</p>
<p>Nathan brought David to a stand.&nbsp; The royal hearer fell
before the faithful preacher.&nbsp; He confessed his sin and
deeply repented.&nbsp; Well might the prophet rejoice over his
illustrious convert.&nbsp; It was indeed success to hear the king
acknowledge his fault.&nbsp; We do not read that he praised the
sermon, but he condemned himself.&nbsp; It is a small <!-- page
96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>reward to hear it said that we have preached a beautiful
sermon, but it is delightful to learn that a sinner has been
convinced of his guilt and danger.&nbsp; Let all of us who
preach, determine that we will not call that service a success
which either allowed our hearers to be drowsy, or won their
applause, without causing a saint to be cheered on his
pilgrimage, or an enemy of God to lay down his weapons and sue
for peace.</p>
<h3>OLD FASHIONED DOCTRINE.<br />
<span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span>, viii. 21 to ix. 16.</h3>
<h4>I.&mdash;He who is loyal to God is the truest
patriot.&mdash;ch. viii., v. 21, ch. ix., v. 10.</h4>
<p>Jeremiah&rsquo;s distress disfigured him, and he felt that
tears were not sufficient to mark his sorrow for his
country.&nbsp; Sinners against God should never profess to be
politicians; they are unworthy to be classed on either side.</p>
<h4>II.&mdash;Idolatry is the mother of all other sins.</h4>
<p>Count up the different crimes these Jewish idol-worshippers
were guilty of&mdash;as lying, slander, adultery, &amp;c.&nbsp;
He who breaks the first commandment has pulled down the fence,
and can easily break the others.&nbsp; What an argument for
Missions!</p>
<h4>III.&mdash;If God acts consistently, He must punish
sin.&mdash;ch. ix., v. 9, 10, 15, 16.</h4>
<p>Hell is as necessary as Heaven to a perfect God.&nbsp; Queen
Victoria could not be safe in her palace but for prisons, where
felons are bound!</p>
<p>He who fears to preach future punishment is either an ignorant
man or a coward.</p>

97</span>XXXVI.&nbsp; SELFISHNESS AND PRAYER.<br />
A CONTRAST.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>So Ahab went up to eat and to
drink</i>.&nbsp; <i>And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel</i>,
<i>and he cast himself down upon the earth</i>, <i>and put his
face between his knees</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span
class="smcap">Kings</span> xviii. 42.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">What a
Contrast</span>!</p>
<p>And yet, both men were perfectly consistent.&nbsp; It is in
each case what you would expect, and yet how differently it might
have been.&nbsp; What a different story it would have been if
only Ahab had listened to the teaching of God!&nbsp; How often we
see men having chances of turning round and beginning a new life;
failing to do this, they seem to become the worse for the lesson
of Providence and the advice of those who warn them!&nbsp; Has it
ever been so with you?&nbsp; Can you remember a time when God
stopped you, and made you think, thus giving you a chance of
reformation?&nbsp; Wretched Ahab! he had just seen which is
Master.&nbsp; How contemptible Baal seemed now!&nbsp; The
heavenly fire, which leaped in answer to Elijah&rsquo;s prayer,
disdained to notice the victims on the altar of the idol, while
the blood of the false priests dyed the waters of the brook
Kishon, a sacrifice to their own wickedness and deception.&nbsp;
One would have thought Ahab&rsquo;s good sense would have
prevailed, and that he would have said, &ldquo;Elijah, I will go
with thee, and on Carmel&rsquo;s top will unite with thee in
prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas for the history that might have
been!</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>But some of you will say, &ldquo;Did not Elijah say to
Ahab, &lsquo;Get thee up, eat and drink?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes,
he did.&nbsp; A few hours before, he had said, &ldquo;If Baal,
follow him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Does not God allow us to be tempted
continually?&nbsp; Did He not, in His wisdom and goodness, place
the tree which bare forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden?&nbsp;
Does He not say, by natural appetites and propensities, enjoy
yourself?&nbsp; There was nothing wrong in eating, but if Ahab
had but</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Denied himself
and gone with Elijah to pray</span>,</p>
<p>the rest of his life would have been different, he might have
been converted then.&nbsp; How often it happens that we hear a
powerful sermon, perhaps on the first Sunday night of a Mission,
but we have something to attend to on Monday, something that
might be left without injury, or it may be a party or a concert,
and so we do not go to the meeting next night.&nbsp; If we had
done so, our whole life might have been changed!</p>
<p>Eat and drink!&nbsp; One wonders it did not choke him, for
were not his subjects starving?&nbsp; The famine was sore in the
land; men and women pined, children died of hunger, cattle and
sheep perished in the fields, but all this, what had it to do
with the king?&nbsp; He was hungry, and would eat and would be
jolly, never mind about the poor people!&nbsp; Remember, my
hearers, you cannot turn your back on God and be the same man you
have been.&nbsp; Each time you say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; to
God&rsquo;s grace, you become less fit for His kingdom.&nbsp; If
men could but see their souls&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">If some of you
could have a Mirror that would shew your soul</span>,</p>
<p>You would look as though you had seen a ghost!&nbsp; We have
portraits of ourselves years ago, and we look at them and <!--
page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>wonder at the change.&nbsp; Could you have a portrait of
what you were, spiritually, ten years since, it would spoil your
enjoyment.&nbsp; Beware, then, of eating and drinking when others
are at prayer.&nbsp; It is better to be good than to be
happy.&nbsp; Do right, though it may mean tears, for the smiles
of selfishness are sores in the future.</p>
<p>Look at the other man now.&nbsp; He climbs the hill.&nbsp;
There is nothing to be won from heaven by laziness.&nbsp; Climb
to thy crown!&nbsp; Never mind the steepness and ruggedness of
the way.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s kings toil and sweat before their
coronation.&nbsp; How Elijah would laugh in his heart as he
thought of the boon he was about to bring down on his
country!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Past victories
encouraged him</span>.</p>
<p>He had prayed that it might not rain, and for many months the
heavens had been cloudless.&nbsp; Day by day the sun had scorched
and burned on, as though there was to be no more verdure, the
trees are but the skeletons of their former selves, and the
ground is cracked, and gapes for drink.&nbsp; Ah! it is soon to
alter!&nbsp; The God who has answered by fire is about to speak
in the shower, and all nature is to put on a new suit of green at
the bidding of prayer.</p>
<p>Why should not the church of God climb the hill to bring down
on the earth a shower of blessing?&nbsp; God had said to Elijah,
&ldquo;I send rain upon the earth,&rdquo; and therefore the man
of God said, &ldquo;I will call upon the name of the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Have we no promise?&nbsp; What do these words
mean&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Whatsoever ye ask in My Name</span>, <span
class="smcap">that will I do</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Find the reference to these words, and then look on them as a
legacy.&nbsp; We may receive whenever we apply.&nbsp; Why, then,
do we hang down our heads?&nbsp; Let us climb Carmel, <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>shouting as we go, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&nbsp; The Lord
reigneth!&rdquo;&nbsp; Baal has not succeeded to the
throne!&nbsp; Christ is there!&nbsp; But see, the man of God
casts himself down on the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Past success
has humbled him</span>.</p>
<p>It is well when it is so.&nbsp; We always tremble when we see
a church elated over its success.&nbsp; A year or two ago, we
Methodists saw a great ingathering of souls, and because we had
harvest we have let our plough rust.&nbsp; Is there any wonder
that we fear a decrease?&nbsp; It is sure to follow elation, and
then we shall be told, &ldquo;There is always a reaction after so
much excitement.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is a text from the
devil&rsquo;s bible.&nbsp; On the same hill top where Elijah won
the fight, he falls down, to pray, with his face between his
knees, and so is most humbled when most triumphant.</p>
<p>And now his servant is sent to look for the sign of
success.&nbsp; Mark you, he sends him to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Look in the
right direction</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do not go towards the dry
land if you want rain, or in other words, if you want success in
soul-saving, look not for it from those who get up entertainments
and seek to make money by gambling in bazaars.&nbsp; Do not
expect conversions from mere eloquence or rhetoric.&nbsp; Large
congregations do not always mean abiding success.&nbsp; Beautiful
chapels are not always remarkable for attracting those who need a
Saviour.&nbsp; Look at the place from whence Wesley, Whitfield,
and the others who were to win souls derived their power.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Do not let
faith be chilled by waiting</span>!</p>
<p>If you wait upon the Lord you have a right to be of good
courage.&nbsp; &ldquo;They shall not be ashamed that wait for Me,
<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>saith the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; If our trust is in the
Lord, we can afford to wait.&nbsp; The longer He keeps us
waiting, the more He will give us.&nbsp; Never mind if the
servant says, &ldquo;There is nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not the
Master&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; Go again.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk to
me of nothing!&nbsp; Go again!&nbsp; Leave me to pray in peace
till there is something to praise God for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">I can praise
Him for the smallest sign</span>.</p>
<p>Only &ldquo;a man&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; sayest thou? but what
Man?&nbsp; It is the same Hand that wrote on the wall the
sentence of Belshazzar.&nbsp; It is the Hand of which David sang
&ldquo;Thou openest Thine Hand and satisfiest the desire of every
living thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; We who look for Jesus remember that
when He left us He did not clench His fist at the world that had
treated Him so ill.&nbsp; &ldquo;He lifted up his hands and
blessed them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He has not closed them yet, but sends
blessings on even the rebellious.&nbsp; Faith sees in the open
hand of Jesus the promise of great gifts for those who wait upon
Him.&nbsp; We read, directly, &ldquo;the heaven was black, and
there was a great rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we pass over a few years we see the end of these men, the
end so far as this world is concerned.&nbsp; They both ride in
chariots.&nbsp; He who rose up to eat and drink, rides disguised,
but is not able to deceive the winged messengers of death.&nbsp;
The murderer is found out, and dies in his chariot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Goes to Hell in
his Chariot</span>!</p>
<p>So perish those who prefer to eat when others starve, though
they might unite with those who bring blessings on the
perishing!</p>
<p>A year afterwards, the man who prayed walks along the road;
there is one by his side who watches him with eager glance, and
now comes the chariot of heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span><span
class="smcap">God sends His Carriage to meet</span></p>
<p>the man who climbed the hill to pray, and soon he is parted
from his young friend; but see! his mantle falls.&nbsp; Which of
us will pick it up and wear it?&nbsp; Elijah&rsquo;s garment will
fit any of us, and will always be new if we pray.&nbsp; It grows
threadbare and shabby when worn by those who prefer the table to
the altar, and love the pleasures of the world better than the
companionship of angels.</p>
<p>My brothers, shall we not become mighty in prayer?&nbsp; This
is a talent all have received, put it out to interest at
once.&nbsp; Lose no time in its use.&nbsp; Satan will gladly lend
you a napkin, but then he will have your soul as the
pledge.&nbsp; To cease to pray is to drift towards hell.&nbsp; Is
there not a needs be for crying mightily to God?&nbsp; Can we
look around our congregations and not feel that it is high time
we went up the hill to cry to God for the rain that means
revival?&nbsp; Let us each ask the question, Am I most like the
man who lived to gratify his desires, or the man who lived to
pray for others?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">With whom shall
I spend my Eternity</span>, <span class="smcap">with Elijah of
Ahab</span>?</p>
<p>If the angels see us on our face, crying for rain, they will
know that some day they will have to meet us and take us home in
the chariot of fire.&nbsp; If they see that we are those who eat
and drink when they should pray, they will know that our
possessions, like Ahab&rsquo;s chariot, will become a hearse, and
that we are riding to hell in that which we have chosen for
comfort.</p>

<p>Of course she was.&nbsp; All God&rsquo;s trains meet at the
junction.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t have to wait for one
another.&nbsp; Elijah had left Cherith because the brook had
dried up, and his first request shewed that he was in need of
water.&nbsp; The poor widow seems to have been relieved that
water was all the prophet asked, but he called to her to fetch a
bit of bread as well.&nbsp; This broke her down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
Master, we have not so much as a cake.&nbsp; I have only a
handful of meal, and I had come out to gather some sticks that I
might bake a little cake for me and the lad, and then we shall

never fear.&nbsp; Ravens can wait at table as well as any

servants.&nbsp; My God shall supply all your need, and the less
there is in the barrel, the more room for God&rsquo;s hand!</p>
<h3>&ldquo;IT IS THE BLOOD THAT SAVES.&rdquo;<br />
<span class="smcap">Exodus</span> xii.</h3>
<p>The Israelites were not saved because they were children of
Abraham, but because they followed the plan of salvation.&nbsp;
Even Moses &ldquo;kept the passover and the sprinkling of
blood,&rdquo; or there would have been a dead man in the
house.&nbsp; If you and I are saved, it must be by the blood of
the Lamb.&nbsp; The father who put the blood on his door posts
was not ashamed to own his need of Divine protection, or that he
trusted the word of God.</p>
<p>There is a false sentimentality that is abroad to-day, which
would make us ashamed to speak of the atonement.&nbsp; We are
told that it is sickening to hear of such terms as &ldquo;The
Blood of Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">What is the
standard of taste</span>?</p>
<p>We know of nothing higher than the word of God, and he whose
fine feelings are shocked by Bible language, would find heaven
not sufficiently &aelig;sthetic.&nbsp; May not such be said to
count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing?&nbsp; When the
destroyer is abroad, we shall be safe who hide behind the
blood.&nbsp; We rejoice in the blood of sprinkling, when we
believe there is wrath for the sinner.&nbsp; The giving God the
lie, when He declares He will punish His enemies, fits the mouth
of him who is too refined to speak of the precious blood of
Jesus.</p>
<h2><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>XXXVIII.&nbsp; &ldquo;DO MEN GATHER
GRAPES OF THORNS?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This question was asked by a man who knew more than any one
else, and he knew very well what the answer would be.&nbsp; We
should suspect a man of insanity who looked for grapes on a thorn
bush.&nbsp; And yet we see numbers of both men and women looking
for happiness and comfort in the Public House, and judging from
their appearance afterwards, we feel sure they went for grapes
and found festering thorns!</p>
<p>It was our duty, some time ago, to be part of a deputation to
support a memorial to the Magistrates at what is called
&ldquo;The Brewster Sessions.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a number of
Ministers and others who represent the Temperance movement, with
some ladies like-minded, and we took our places in the same court
where the publicans and their friends were.&nbsp; Some of these
had come to transfer licenses, others to seek to have
in-beershops, and power to sell other kinds of drink.&nbsp; The
Magistrates, however, refused both of the applications for new
licenses, nor did we wonder, when we saw those who were waiting
to be punished or pardoned, as the case might be.</p>
<p>In the gallery were a number of the friends of those who were
waiting to have their names called upon, and then to appear in
the dock.&nbsp; Besides these, were the usual loafers, many of
whom have found, or will find work for the police, after going to
seek grapes where thorns grow: and then <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>others,
like the writer, who were on the lookout for a profitable way to
spend an hour or two.&nbsp; It was a most instructive time, and
one wonders how it is that long-headed Englishmen can, after
seeing the results of visiting the publichouse, ever be persuaded
that grapes are to be got there without trouble.</p>
<p>The mistake many good people make is looking on drinking as a
failing, and not as a crime.&nbsp; It must be a sin for any one
to make himself eligible for doing all sorts of mischief and
wrong, as men do who take, as they say, &ldquo;a sup of
drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is this sup of drink that gives them the
impetus towards cruelty and lust, and we must insist upon it that
for a man to prepare himself for wickedness is a sin against
himself and his God.&nbsp; If this be so, the social element in
drinking makes it all the more dangerous.&nbsp; Men and women
drink often because it is considered a kind and hospitable thing
to offer it, and an ungenerous and churlish thing to refuse
it.&nbsp; What is this but calling a thorn a vine?</p>
<p>While we were in the court, several cases came before the
Magistrates&mdash;&ldquo;Drunk and Disorderly,&rdquo; varied by
obscenity and quarrelling.&nbsp; One woman told the Bench that
she had been teetotal for five and a half years, till she came
into the town to pay a debt, and then she had a glass, &ldquo;and

&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said &ldquo;His Worship,&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Listen
to no Friend that wants you to take Drink</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another poor wretch was &ldquo;Drunk and
Incapable.&rdquo;&nbsp; She told the Magistrates that she had
come to get a situation, that her box was at the station.&nbsp;
She had evidently seen better days.&nbsp; The Chairman said how
sorry he was to see <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>a woman like her, evidently a
superior person, in such a case, and she gladly promised to be a
better woman, but she had been more than once to the thorn for
grapes, and we fear will go again.&nbsp; There was a young fellow
brought up for drunkenness and obscenity, whose fine was paid by
his mother.&nbsp; She looked a decent but poor woman, and one
could not but wonder what she had parted with to raise the money,
to keep what one of the Magistrates called a blackguard, out of
prison.&nbsp; But what will not a mother&rsquo;s love do!&nbsp;
These are a few of the cases which made us wonder that in our
town we have so many places, licensed by the same Magistrates, to
sell that which fits men and women to appear in the court to be
punished.</p>
<p>We wonder how long it will take to make the English people see
that so long as we allow drinking shops to abound, there will be
a necessity for police and lock-ups, and that it is as easy to
gather grapes of thorns as to expect peace and quietness and
facilities for drinking to exist together?</p>

<h2><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>XXXIX.&nbsp; NO BALLOT-BOX.</h2>
<p>We see that certain politicians are busy trying to convince
those who have any fear upon the matter, that it is easy for them
to vote in such a way that no one can possibly find out for which
side they have given in their vote.&nbsp; It is positively secret
voting.&nbsp; Very likely this is as it should be, still it is a
sad disgrace that such a thing should be at all necessary, and
does not speak well for human nature.&nbsp; Why should it not be
possible for men to vote openly?&nbsp; Because some who have done
so have had to suffer loss.&nbsp; Is not this a blot upon our
civilization, to say nothing of our Christianity?</p>
<p>But while it may be right that men should have the chance of
voting secretly in Parliamentary matters, whether they be
Conservatives or Liberals, we contend there should be no
ballot-box for the election in which men settle whether Jesus or
Satan should govern the world.&nbsp; There are sadly too many,
who are like Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, disciples, but secretly
for fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">We want no
Secret Votes</span>.</p>
<p>Say right out which side you are for.&nbsp; If this were the
case, there would be a large number of absentees from public
worship next Sabbath; whole pews would be empty because there is
not one of the usual tenants who loves God, and yet they dare not
say openly, I am for the Devil.&nbsp; On the other hand, if some
were to say what is in their hearts, <!-- page 109--><a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>they would
have to leave the dinner-tables where filthy jokes are bandied
about, there being no women present.&nbsp; And in some workshops
and mills, men and women would have to speak out at the cost of
ridicule and scorn.&nbsp; Yes, speak out, when they hear that
which is opposed to truth and purity made the subject of daily
conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Stand
up</span>, <span class="smcap">stand up for
Jesus</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>we often sing in our meetings, and yet some who sing these
words are craven in the presence of the foe.&nbsp; We should do
well to take the advice of the same song when it says,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Let
Courage rise with Danger</span>,&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should think that man unfit for a soldier&rsquo;s life who
was not ready to unfurl his country&rsquo;s flag, and let it be
known for whom he is fighting.&nbsp; What is the position of
those who read this paper?&nbsp; Do you, in your heart, believe
that Jesus has the right to reign?&nbsp; Then shew it!&nbsp; Lose
no time to put on Christ!&nbsp; Let all men see that you believe
in the righteousness of our cause.&nbsp; Do not hide the love you
have for Jesus.&nbsp; Let not your chance of being honourably
wounded pass by.&nbsp; In heaven, should you reach it, there will
be no opportunity of suffering for Him who loved you to the
death.</p>

<h2><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>XL.&nbsp; &ldquo;WHAT CHRISTIANS MAY
LEARN FROM POLITICIANS.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Many a time, during an election, we have wished that we could
see the church of God as much in earnest to send men to heaven as
they are to send those they vote for to Parliament.&nbsp; It must
strike some of the ungodly, when they have Christian men at them
day and night</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Canvassing</span>,</p>
<p>not taking No as an answer, but doing their utmost to win
them&mdash;How is it that this Christian, who knows that I never
attend a place of worship, has not shown one-hundredth part of
this zeal to get me to go to chapel or to begin to pray?&nbsp; Is
he not likely to think;&mdash;after all, he does not believe his
Bible, or he could not be as careless about my soul as he is?</p>
<p>Men of business have no time to seek the souls of the lost;
that is parson&rsquo;s work; that must be left to
Sunday;&mdash;and yet, we have seen, during the election, keen,
clever business men, up and down stairs, calling on their
neighbours, and making sure that they have given their vote on
the right side, and this in addition to many a visit paid since
the candidates were selected, and the time drew nigh for getting
them returned.</p>
<p>How freely they bear ridicule!&nbsp; Men who would blush to
talk of religion do not hesitate to be sneered at for the sake of
their party, wearing their colour and priding themselves on their
opinions.&nbsp; We have nothing to say against <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>this.&nbsp;
Men ought to have the courage of their opinions, but why not own
up and play the man for Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>We should like to know what the election has cost for</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Printing</span>.</p>
<p>Many thousands of pounds have been spent, and spent freely,
without a grudge, for placards and cartoons.&nbsp; Any man who
had a new idea in the shape of a striking advertisement could
have it adopted by his party, regardless of cost.&nbsp; All this,
too, we don&rsquo;t object to, but we say that if any of us
Evangelists wanted to spend a small proportion of this amount in
trying to get men and women to come to God&rsquo;s house during a
Mission, there would be a tremendous outcry against his</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Extravagance</span>!</p>
<p>One interesting feature in this matter is the large number
of</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Private
Carriages</span></p>
<p>used to convey voters to the poll.&nbsp; It was very amusing
to see some of the men riding in state, in the custody of the
owner of the carriage!&nbsp; It was good to tell they had not
been used to it, and felt that they were on their good
behaviour.&nbsp; What struck some of us was the readiness of
ladies and gentlemen to lend their vehicles for this
purpose.&nbsp; We can have no possible objection to this, but we
wonder what would be said to us if we counselled them to send
their carriages to bring the aged and feeble to the house of
God?&nbsp; We should be told that we had no idea of the fitness
of things.&nbsp; This would be true if heaven were less than
earth, and politics of more importance than religion.</p>
<p><!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>It is a queer world, and we wonder sometimes if the
time will ever come when men shall believe their Bibles as much
as their newspapers?&nbsp; As we have seen during the last few
days, professing Christians of the most apathetic order, going
half wild about Whigs and Tories, we have said to ourselves,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">When the Son of
Man cometh</span>, <span class="smcap">shall He find faith on the
earth</span>?</p>
<h3>DON&rsquo;T FLATTER THE DEVIL!<br />
<span class="smcap">Acts</span>, xvii.</h3>
<p>We read that the Apostle &ldquo;was grieved&rdquo; to hear
this possessed woman speaking favourably of him and his
companion.&nbsp; He could not bear for it to be even suspected
that his mission was tolerated by the devil.&nbsp; Her masters
made money by her wrongdoing, and he would not have their
patronage.&nbsp; He and Silas were happier in the cell, sore and
hungry as they were, than in listening to the praise given by the
evil one!</p>
<p>It is better to have frowns than favour from those who are
opposed to truth and righteousness.&nbsp; Let Evangelists and
such like,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">beware of the
favour of the wicked</span>.</p>
<p>Do not seek the smiles of those who live by wrong doing.&nbsp;
We shall never cast out the devil while conniving at his
crimes.&nbsp; It is not by popularity that we win our greatest
victories.&nbsp; Paul had no converts he prized more than those
who formed the Church in the town where he had been in
jail.&nbsp; Let those of us who love an easy and painless life
think of his words&mdash;</p>

<h2><!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span

FOUND IN THE BIBLE.</h2>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mr. Justice
Groves</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Men go into the Public-house
respectable</i>, <i>and come out felons</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My text, as you see, my dear readers, is not taken from the
Bible.&nbsp; It does not, however, contradict the Scriptures, but
is in harmony with some, such as &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Woe
unto him that giveth his neighbour drink</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Habakkuk ii. 15; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Woe unto them that
rise up early in the morning</span>, <span class="smcap">that
they may follow strong drink</span>.&rdquo;&mdash;Isaiah v.
11.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Take heed to yourselves lest
at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and
drunkenness</span>.&rdquo;&mdash;Luke xxi. 34.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Be not among
winebibbers</span>.&rdquo;&mdash;Proverbs xxiii. 20.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The statement
of the text is likely to be true</span>,</p>
<p>as it was spoken by an English Judge, and given as the result
of long observation, and of hearing evidence given upon
oath.&nbsp; What is more likely to be true than a declaration
from the Bench? and as such it deserves the attention of every
one of us.&nbsp; Let us then consider</p>
<h3>(I.)&mdash;IF THIS STATEMENT BE TRUE, THE PUBLIC-HOUSE SHOULD
BE AVOIDED.</h3>
<p>We are quite willing to allow that a certain amount of
enjoyment can be obtained in these places.&nbsp; Once acquire the
taste, and drink gives pleasure to the palate, and produces, in a
very short time, a kind of joy.&nbsp; Men who are <!-- page
114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>in
business difficulties can forget their creditors.&nbsp; Those who
have lost friends by death can forget the ties of
affection.&nbsp; Scolding wives are left at home, and a smiling
face receives the money spent, for the landlady is real good to
those who have the coin.&nbsp; But on the other hand, are not
these drinkers paying too dear for their gladness?&nbsp; Is it
not a kind of delirium that shuts out the facts of the
case?&nbsp; Will not the creditor call for his money?&nbsp; Will
you not wake up to greater loneliness than ever?&nbsp; Will you
have taken the edge off the woman&rsquo;s tongue by spending the
money she needs for the family?&nbsp; Are you not buying
temporary insanity at so much a glass?</p>
<p>Are you not running a fearful risk of becoming a
criminal?&nbsp; I know of a little beershop where murders have
been hatched, and that in a quiet rural village!&nbsp; Do not men
go primed with drink to rob and slay?&nbsp; Do not wife-beaters
get their inspiration at the public-house?&nbsp; Is not gambling
fostered in the bar parlour?&nbsp; Do you tell me that you are
not likely to become a thief, or a murderer?&nbsp; So others have
said whom we have known, once as decent and quiet as you.&nbsp;
Besides, if you keep out of the hands of the police, you will
have to take your trial some day for robbing God, and for soul
murder!&nbsp; In the public-house you learn to do all this.</p>
<h3>(II.)&mdash;IF THIS STATEMENT BE TRUE, ALL PATRIOTS SHOULD
OPPOSE THE PUBLIC-HOUSE.</h3>
<p>How can a man love his country, who supports that which is
increasing taxation and demoralising his countrymen?&nbsp; Should
we allow any nation under the sun to do us the harm one
public-house will do?&nbsp; Is it not true that nearly all the
police are needed by those who frequent the Public-house?&nbsp;
Is it not this devil&rsquo;s academy that costs the <!-- page
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>nation so much more than we spend in education?&nbsp;
Would not many of the prisons have to be pulled down if we could
stop the drinking habits of our people?&nbsp; Answer me these
questions, and tell me how you can call yourself a patriot, and
yet help to keep these places going?</p>
<h3>(III.)&mdash;IF THIS STATEMENT BE TRUE, WE MUST CLOSE THE
PUBLIC-HOUSES.</h3>
<p>Can it be tolerated that such places should remain open?&nbsp;
Are felons to be manufactured, and men get rich by the
process?&nbsp; We must shut the places up, even though we ruin
places like Burton-on-Trent, and compel rich brewers to sell
their carriages.&nbsp; Nothing is so likely to pay off the
National Debt as to cause publicans and brewers to enlarge the
list of bankrupts.&nbsp; They cannot live but by the
nation&rsquo;s loss, and sorrow.&nbsp; A brewer&rsquo;s dray, as
it leaves the yard, carries with it increase to the taxation, and
hunger and nakedness for little children!</p>
<p>While we do not lose sight of the importance of legislation,
and while we push the questions of Sunday Closing, Local Option,
&amp;c., to the utmost extent, it will pay us still better to
close the public-house through making the frequenter of such
places see the sin of it.&nbsp; If there are no customers, there
will be soon a closing of their doors.&nbsp; We call upon all
Grocers, Butchers, Tailors, Cabinet Makers, and all decent
tradespeople, to see, that would they have a return of
prosperity, they must have the stream of cash which goes into the
publican&rsquo;s till turned towards their doors.&nbsp; Money
spent in manufacturing felons would look well spent on Clothes,
Provisions, and Furniture.&nbsp; Besides churches and chapels
would be crowded as the jails were emptied, and heaven would gain
what hell would lose by the closing of Breweries, Distilleries,
and Public-houses.</p>
<h3><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>XLII.&nbsp; GOOD-WILL TO MEN.</h3>
<p>That is one of the messages brought to us by Christmas time,
and this is linked to &ldquo;glory to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; You
cannot glorify God more than by publishing good-will to one
another.&nbsp; There is a special need for this just now.&nbsp;
Political feeling has risen so high that friends, and even
families, have been estranged.&nbsp; Let not another sun go down
upon your wrath.&nbsp; Now is the time to prove that you are a
Christian, by giving Jesus the pleasure of knowing that His
birthday was the burial day of strife.</p>
<p>Which side shall be the first to move?&nbsp; Doubtless the
noblest; the one who has most of God in him will hurry to say,
&ldquo;Come, now, let us reason together.&rdquo;&nbsp; We need
not to say that common-place religion cannot afford to do
this.&nbsp; Those who live on old manna cannot rise to such
dignity as to be the first to seek the friendship of those who
think themselves aggrieved.&nbsp; On the other hand, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">He that humbleth himself shall be
exalted</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heaven has always been the first to
seek reconciliation, and those who are heavenly-minded shew it by
making haste to be friendly.</p>
<p>If you have been the injured one, you have the best chance of
succeeding in healing the wound.&nbsp; It is God, sending a
message of peace, that wins over His foes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">He does not
wait for us to move first</span>.</p>
<p>Who asked Him to offer His Son?&nbsp; If you take the first
<!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>step, you will be treading in the footprints of
Jesus.&nbsp; He has shown us how to love our enemies, and to do
good to them that despitefully use us.&nbsp; It is true that you
would have to make a sacrifice, to be the first to hold out the
white flag.&nbsp; Yes, and you can afford to do it, if you are
the one in the right.&nbsp; It is the man who is in the wrong who
is the easiest offended, and the last to yield.</p>
<p>Whether we are Conservatives or Liberals, we are Englishmen,
and cannot afford to be divided.&nbsp; Whether we want the Church
to be Disestablished or not, we are Christians.&nbsp; Let us be
friends once more, and try to think the best we can of each
other.&nbsp; Whether our side has won or not, we are certain that
Right will prevail in the long run.&nbsp; We can afford to wait,
if we are on God&rsquo;s side, for He wins by losing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The loss of His
Son was His greatest Gain</span>.</p>
<p>If you can rise to this, how you will enjoy singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hark! the herald angels sing&mdash;<br />
Glory to our new-born King!<br />
Peace on earth and mercy mild,<br />
God and sinners reconciled.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there not wondrous common sense, as well as beauty, in the
saying of St. John&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Beloved</span>, <span class="smcap">if God so loved
us</span>, <span class="smcap">we ought</span><br />
<span class="smcap">also to love one another</span>.</p>
<p>One would have thought it would have been&mdash;we ought to
love Him.&nbsp; But then we remember further on, John says,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">He that
loveth not his brother</span>, <span class="smcap">whom
he</span><br />
<span class="smcap">hath seen</span>, <span class="smcap">how can
he love God whom</span><br />
<span class="smcap">he hath not seen</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>It is well sometimes to ask ourselves the question,
&ldquo;How will this matter look in heaven?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What shall we think of ourselves a hundred years to
come?&nbsp; How small all these matters of offence will seem in
the light of eternity!&nbsp; We should not like to die without
being at peace with all men.&nbsp; The way to secure this is to
live at peace, and if there is anything between us and our
brethren, let us treat one another as we wish God to treat
us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Good-will to
men</span>!</p>
<h3>&ldquo;A FELLOW-FEELING MAKES US WONDROUS KIND.&rdquo;<br />
<span class="smcap">A word to the Aged who are able to help
others</span>.</h3>
<p>This is quite true, and we wish there was more of this
fellow-feeling.&nbsp; It is likely this will be read by some aged
man or woman who has many comforts, and is assisted to bear the
infirmities peculiar to old age in a way poor men and women
cannot enjoy.&nbsp; If you are wealthy, or have enough for your
wants, should you not have a fellow-feeling for those who are
poor and need help?</p>
<p>Sometimes when visiting aged people, who were well off, a nice
fire burning all the night through, and perhaps those about them
who have not allowed them to be many hours without nourishment, I
have said to such an one, &ldquo;You have been kept alive by the
fact that you can afford it.&nbsp; If you had been a poor man,
you would be dead now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Will you not then, if you have it in your power, give some
other old man or woman, who is poor and unable to get the
comforts you have in such plenty, some share of what you have; if
you do not, how can you expect God to shew you mercy in that
day?&nbsp; It will be no use to tell Him that you loved Him; He
does not believe in professions of affection for Him, which are
not proved by love to our fellows.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 119</span>XLIII.&nbsp; OPPORTUNITY: BEING
THOUGHTS FOR THE NEW YEAR.<br />
ON NEW YEAR&rsquo;S EVE.</h2>
<p>We have heard a story told of a celebrated sculptor who had a
statue in his studio of a beautiful veiled figure with winged
feet; when asked what he called it, he said
&ldquo;Opportunity.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But why is it
veiled?&nbsp; And why has it wings on its feet?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is not recognised, and
never stays long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How true this is!&nbsp; The New Year, which comes to-morrow,
brings with it opportunities for becoming better, and being of
greater use than we have ever been.&nbsp; But, alas! how few of
us will recognise the good chance till it has passed for
ever.</p>
<p>Some of us have special opportunities for growing better with
age.&nbsp; We live with those who have always shewn us a good
example, and have the privilege of listening every Sabbath Day to
those who explain the Book of God, so as to feed our souls with
bread Divine.&nbsp; Those of us who are not so fortunate, who, it
may be, have our lot cast among the ungodly; yet we, though at
Patmos, may have revelations which some do not enjoy who have
more help from friends and good influences.</p>
<p>But does not the past admonish those of us who are Preachers
and Teachers?&nbsp; How many opportunities are past, to return no
more!&nbsp; How much more useful we should <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>have been
had we made use of them!&nbsp; How we might have preached Christ
instead of our own selves!&nbsp; How we might have encouraged and
stimulated our hearers, if only we had caught more of the spirit
of Jesus!&nbsp; How much power from above there would have been
in our addresses, if we had spent more time alone; and how many
more souls would have been converted, if we had not restrained
prayer!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>But the past is past.&nbsp; The future dawns, and in its
kindling light let us re-consecrate ourselves to the work God has
set us to do.&nbsp; We shall have appointments to preach.&nbsp;
Shall we not look on each appointment, however distant the place,
or small the congregation, as</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">a heaven-sent
opportunity</span>?</p>
<p>Let us make the most of it.&nbsp; Shall not the new opening
for usefulness find us prepared to enter in?&nbsp; Must it ever
be said again that the pulpit was open to us, but we were not
ready to fill it as it ought to be filled?&nbsp; Could an angel
from heaven desire anything better than the opportunity which
will come to so many, next Sunday, of preaching, or it may be, of
teaching a class of young people out of the Word of God?</p>
<p>If we need a stimulus, let us ask ourselves the
question,&mdash;How shall I feel, looking at my past chances of
usefulness from the observatory of the sick room and dying
bed?&nbsp; Are we to fill our dying pillows with thorns, as we
remember Sabbaths when we gave way to indolence and
self-indulgence, instead of crowding them with well-aimed efforts
after usefulness, and diligently employed occasions for study and
teaching.</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>To the unconverted reader we say,&mdash;Beware, lest
this New Year be wasted as its predecessors were.&nbsp; Is it to
be like all the rest?&nbsp; Is that which comes to thee as a
friend, wishing to give thee space for repentance and faith, to
become another lash in the scourge which is to punish thy soul
for ever?&nbsp; Is God&rsquo;s ledger still to chronicle thy
unforgiven debts; unforgiven, not because there was no mercy, but
because thou wast too indolent to pray.&nbsp; Rouse thyself,
sinner, lest these very opportunities should add to thy
doom!&nbsp; They fly past thee, but where do they go?&nbsp; They
are on their way to the bar of God, to witness against
thee.&nbsp; What a crowd of them to testify!&nbsp; Wouldst thou
silence them?&nbsp; Come, ere this year closes, and the new one
begins, to the feet of Jesus, where thou shalt find pardon and
peace, and where thou mayst receive power to live a life of
devotion and holy labour&mdash;thus making opportunity thy
willing and true yoke-fellow.</p>
<h3>PRAYER A VITAL NEED.</h3>
<p>A Poet has said, that Prayer is the Christian&rsquo;s native
air.&nbsp; It seems as if some Christians who are doomed to die
of soul decline, might live if they would go back to their native
air.&nbsp; Reader, do you need this prescription?</p>
<h2><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>XLIV.&nbsp; THE BRITISH
BAYONET.</h2>
<p>A great deal has been said in the newspapers lately on the
subject of Faulty Bayonets.&nbsp; It seems that from some cause
or other these arms have been found out to be faulty and unworthy
of trust.&nbsp; Some of them are brittle, and break, others are
soft, and bend, so there are a large number of those in use which
will have to be discarded on account of unfitness.&nbsp; Where
the blame lies we don&rsquo;t know, but doubtless some one has
been unfaithful to their trust, or the thing could not have been
done.</p>
<p>It set us a thinking the other day&mdash;Here is something
that no one doubted, has proved unreliable; and the thought
flashed across our mind: Is there not something like it in the
Church of God to-day?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">It is the
weapon of the rank and file that is faulty</span>!</p>
<p>It is not the General&rsquo;s brain, or the Officer&rsquo;s
weapon that is unworthy, but the private&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Does this
apply to us?&nbsp; Is not <span class="smcap">prayer</span> to
the Church what the bayonet is to the soldier&mdash;that which
the private member has to use?&nbsp; Those who cannot preach or
write books, or even teach in the Sunday School, can pray.&nbsp;
We ask the question&mdash;Are there as many praying-people in
proportion to our numbers as there used to be?&nbsp; What is the
testimony to those who attend our prayer-meetings?&nbsp; Is not
this the weak place in our army to-day?</p>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

England, and if we are weak here, we are weak where we used to be

of the Lord upon our knees</span>,</p>
<p>and if we are to be soft there, we may as well retire from the
conflict at once.&nbsp; Many a time, when holding Missions, we
have felt that if we could but get the members of society to be
often in secret but earnest prayer, we should carry the battle to
the gate, and more than once we have felt the tide turn, as we
have noticed the people get more and more in an agony of
supplication.</p>
<p>Now that the authorities at the War Office have found out the
failing, we shall soon have the faulty bayonets cast out and
perfect ones provided.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want weak-kneed
Christians cast out of the church, we want them improved.&nbsp;
And this may be done.&nbsp; Let every one of our readers ask the
question</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Am I as strong
in prayer as ever I was</span>?</p>
<p>If not, why not?&nbsp; Or am I one of those who cannot point
to direct answers to pleading prayer, because I never did
plead?&nbsp; Is there not a cause?&nbsp; Look at what James has
said in his epistle, iv. 2-4.&nbsp; Is not this &ldquo;friendship
with the world&rdquo; the cause of this feebleness in
prayer?&nbsp; We want all that we can get in pleasure and
self-indulgence, and to see our church become a power also.&nbsp;
The two things cannot be.&nbsp; This kind goeth not out but by
prayer and fasting, <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>and if we wish to see England won to
Christ we must become reliable in prayer.</p>
<p>We shall be glad to know that what we have said leads to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">An Inspection
of Arms</span>.</p>
<p>Let our Class-leaders ask the question of their
members&mdash;Do you pray in secret?&nbsp; Do you wrestle with
God?&nbsp; How long is it since you had a direct answer to
prayer?&nbsp; This is our weak place.&nbsp; May we soon be strong
where we are now weak, that the prophecy may be fulfilled,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">He that is feeble among you at that
day shall be as David</span>, <span class="smcap">and the House
of David shall be as God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A TEACHER OF SIN.</h3>
<p>Few men have covered themselves with infamy as did Jeroboam,
of whom it is said often he &ldquo;made Israel to
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet what a chance he had to have led the
people, over whom God had made him king, in the path of
righteousness?&nbsp; Instead of teaching evil, he might have led
his people into the ways of the Lord.&nbsp; Influence is a talent
which brings with it enormous responsibility.&nbsp; Perhaps to
none is this more applicable than to parents.&nbsp; Let those of
us to whom God has given children, use our influence to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">teach them
HOLINESS</span>.</p>
<p>We teach them every day by example, if not by precept, and
example is the teacher whose lessons are followed easiest.&nbsp;
What can be worse for a child than to have a parent who teaches
his children to sin?&nbsp; Perhaps at the Day of Judgment, the
most terrible sights will be where children will reproach father
or mother or both, for shewing them the way to the left hand of
God!</p>
<h2><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>XLV.&nbsp; A SERVICE IN THE OLDEN
TIME.<br />
<span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span> viii.</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;The Congregation.</h3>
<p>All who could understand were present (verses 2-3).&nbsp; None
should absent themselves from public worship and the preaching of
God&rsquo;s word, except infants and idiots.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;The Behaviour of the Hearers.</h3>
<p>We are told (verse 3) &ldquo;All the people were
attentive.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are some who go to God&rsquo;s
house, and make such poor use of their ears, that they will wish
at the Judgment Day they had been born deaf.&nbsp; We read also
of the reverence of the people.&nbsp; They &ldquo;stood up&rdquo;
to listen, and joined in the prayer with a great
&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;&nbsp; What a scene we have depicted in verses
5-6.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;The Preachers.</h3>
<p>There was a <span class="smcap">pulpit</span>, but not the
tub-like thing that we see in some places&mdash;it held more than
a dozen.&nbsp; It would be high enough for all the people to hear
and see.&nbsp; But Ezra had more sense than to have it so high
that he and his helpers were separated from their hearers.&nbsp;
Pulpits should help, not hinder the preacher.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Preacher
spoke plainly</span>,</p>
<p>verse 8.&nbsp; They read &ldquo;distinctly.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
sometimes listen to a man whom we cannot hear, and it is a pain
and grief to us to see his lips move, but because he drops his
voice <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>when he has anything extra good to
say, we lose the best.&nbsp; Such Preachers forget that
&ldquo;faith comes by hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Preachers
made the people understand</span>,<br />
verse 8.</p>
<p>This is one of the duties of Preachers, to make their hearers
understand the Bible, so that the man who does not teach as well
as preach has not done all that he has been called to do.&nbsp;
That is the best kind of Preacher, who not only stirs up the
people like a poker, but puts fuel on at the same time.</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;The Effects of the Service.</h3>
<p>First, there was sorrow of heart.&nbsp; No one can understand
the Bible and not be moved.&nbsp; The Levites, however, showed
their people that God would like them to be happy.&nbsp; Those
who weep over the Bible may well be comforted.&nbsp; Let those
weep who have not listened to God&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>One blessed result of the sacred joy which followed the
weeping, was the</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">help rendered
to the poor</span>,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">send portions</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(verses 10-12).&nbsp; It would be well if, after every good
time we had at chapel, we made the poor to rejoice.&nbsp; If God
feeds you with the Bread of Life, send a loaf of bread or a bit
of meat to some who are likely to go hungry!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Let the godly
be glad</span>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>XLVI.&nbsp; KEEP THE FIRE BURNING
WHILE THE FROST LASTS!</h2>
<p>Many railway travellers, besides ourselves, have been often
much pleased with the provision made at the principal railway
stations for supplying the engines with water.&nbsp; Water is a
necessity of motion to the locomotive, and there are watering
stations all along the line.&nbsp; Every driver knows where these
water-tanks are, and he takes care to stop in time, to get his
boiler filled.&nbsp; If he did not look to this, he would find
himself stopping between stations, and would have to submit to
the indignity of being drawn by another engine!</p>
<p>If such a thing occurred, it would be a sort of picture of
some Christian workers, men and women, who in days that are past,
were remarkable for their zeal and push, but who, for want of
grace, have had to cease to work, and are now content to be drawn
along by other Christians.&nbsp; We know Ministers, Local
Preachers, and Class-Leaders, who in their day were notable soul
winners, but alas, now, when there is a revival, they cannot take
the lead, but they are helped along by others, perhaps of less
power than they once possessed!&nbsp; What a spectacle to men and
angels!</p>
<p>But this is not what we are writing about just now.&nbsp;
During the long frost, which we hope has now passed away for the
season, many of us have been pleased with the pains which have
been taken to keep the water from freezing in the pipe which
leads from the tank to the supply-spout for the engine.&nbsp;
Night and day, for weeks, a fire has been kept <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>burning, so
as to have the iron column always hot.&nbsp; Orders have been
given to keep the fire burning while the frost lasts, and these
orders have been obeyed, or we should have seen some poor driver
obliged to wire to send another engine to help on the train which
would have been delayed.&nbsp; To pursue the analogy, has not
God&rsquo;s business been delayed because the fire has not been
kept burning?&nbsp; This is a time of spiritual frost.&nbsp; What
with the political crisis, general election, depression in trade,
there has been spiritual ice in all the Churches of our
land.&nbsp; The very supply pipes have been frozen, and men of
power are at present quiet, because they have not received the
Water of Life.&nbsp; We know men of God, men who are earnest,
loyal, trustful souls, who are weeping between the porch and the
altar, on account of their want of power.&nbsp; What is to be
done?&nbsp; Men of Israel, help!&nbsp; Come to the rescue!&nbsp;
Let us get the fires lighted.&nbsp; To your knees!&nbsp; To your
knees!&nbsp; Bring the promises.&nbsp; Keep fuel always in hand,
so as to replenish the blaze, and we shall see the frozen water
leap out to fill again those who so often have drawn the train
heavenward!</p>

class="pagenum">p. 129</span>XLVII.&nbsp; THE SOWER.</h2>
<p>One of the Master&rsquo;s most wonderful parables begins,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Behold</span>, <span class="smcap">a
sower went forth to</span> sow.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many
lessons in that instructive analogy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">You cannot sow wheat on the parlour
carpet</span>.&nbsp; You must go forth.&nbsp; If the world could
be converted by self-indulgent theorists, we should have had the
Millenium here long ago.&nbsp; It is impossible to read any
Christian, newspaper without coming across some of these
drawing-room farmers&mdash;men who can sit at their fireside, and
show you how to do it!&nbsp; Ask them where their barns are, and
they will have excuses to make as to why their plans have not
succeeded.&nbsp; We have heard these gentlemen hold forth in a
Quarterly Meeting, and have had hard work to keep our temper, and
have not always been supposed to have succeeded.&nbsp; We may,
however, settle it that Mr. Plan-others-their-work could put all
the harvest he ever had in his waistcoat pocket!</p>
<p>Would you need a waggon for your gains, you must leave ease
and dignity behind, and trudge over the heavy furrows, seed
basket in hand.</p>
<p>Secondly, as the preachers say,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">You must sow where the plough has been
first</span>.&nbsp; A great deal of seed is lost because the
ground has not been prepared.&nbsp; Of late years the cry has
been &ldquo;Believe!&nbsp; Believe!&rdquo;&nbsp; But what must we
believe?&nbsp; &ldquo;Believe on <!-- page 130--><a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>Jesus,&rdquo; say they.&nbsp; Yes, but have they
believed what the Bible says about sin?&nbsp; Those who do not
believe in the guiltiness of sin, cannot believe on Christ.&nbsp;
Till men see they have been in the wrong, they will not
understand the &ldquo;righteousness which is by faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let the ploughshare of repentance make the land ready for the
seed, and then there will be some hope of lasting success.&nbsp;
Some other time we may have something to say about the birds,
which pick up the seed; but for the present let it suffice that
we insist upon the ploughman doing his work before the sower
comes to do his.&nbsp; We have a notion that it would be well if
the seed-basket were left at home for a while, and some one were
to take hold of the plough.&nbsp; Before to-day we have found,
when we have gone to begin a Mission, that it was of little use
to preach Christ as a Saviour.&nbsp; Men and women who are not
convinced of the sins of their life, need to be told of the
punishment which awaits those who die with their sins
unpardoned.&nbsp; We have been too mealy-mouthed, and have feared
to offend our hearers; and so the seed has fallen on hard ground,
and the birds only have a successful Mission!</p>

LEARNED AT EMMAUS.<br />
<span class="smcap">Luke</span> xxiv. 13-35.</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;When friends speak of good things, Jesus draws
near.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;These things&rdquo; which concern Jesus.&nbsp; Even if
men speak sorrowfully, if it is of Jesus they speak, He is
nigh.&nbsp; If He were the subject of conversation more, His
friends would have more of His company.&nbsp; If you are shy of
Him, He will be shy of you.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;Unbelief manufactures sorrow for the godly.</h3>
<p>Jesus said they looked &ldquo;sad.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a pity
to employ unbelief; he does not know how to make a smile.&nbsp;
When he tries it is a misfit.&nbsp; If the disciples had believed
Jesus, they would have been dancing for joy, for they would have
been round the tomb to see Him rise.&nbsp; We have lost that
picture, because no one believed the Lord enough to expect His
words to be fulfilled.&mdash;Mark viii. 31.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Never expect infidels to be converted while saints
are sceptical.</h3>
<p>Certain women had told them, but they were &ldquo;slow of
heart to believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is not this tardiness of faith the
secret of popular infidelity?&nbsp; If Christians shewed their
faith by works, Bradlaugh, and such like, would have no audiences
when they lectured!</p>
<h3><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>IV.&mdash;Suffering was the duty of
Christ, as the servant of God.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Ought not Christ to have suffered?&rdquo;&nbsp; Before
He could have the wages, He must do the work.&nbsp; Eternity
alone gives space for the payment of what He earned in Gethsemane
and on Calvary.</p>
<h3>V.&mdash;The Old Testament was Jesus Christ&rsquo;s
Bible.</h3>
<p>Has it the place it ought to have in our hearts?&nbsp; These
men had their hearts warmed while Christ expounded Psalms and
Prophecies.&nbsp; He will do the same to you, if you will ask
Him.&nbsp; It is a reflection upon the Holy Ghost to make use of
so small a portion of the Bible as some do.</p>
<h3>VI.&mdash;Hospitality is a remunerative virtue.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I was a stranger, and ye took me in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Christ blesses the cupboard from which wayfarers are fed.&nbsp;
They fed Jesus, and He filled their hearts with deathless
joy.</p>
<h3>VII.&mdash;Apostates lose the best news.</h3>
<p>Judas had gone out of hearing when the eleven had heard of a
risen Christ.</p>
<h3>VIII.&mdash;Testifying to grace received brings fresh
supplies.</h3>
<p>It was while telling what they had seen that they heard the
voice of Jesus speak peace.</p>
<h2><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>XLIX.&nbsp; WORK FOR BOYS.<br />
1 <span class="smcap">Samuel</span> iii.I.&mdash;There is work in
God&rsquo;s house for Boys to do.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The child Samuel ministered.&rdquo;&nbsp; When you sing
with feeling you do God&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; When you see some one
without a hymn-book and you take one to the stranger, you
minister.&nbsp; When you make room for a stranger to sit by you,
then you do the work of the Lord.&nbsp; When you pray for the
preacher, then you are of use.</p>
<h2>II.&mdash;Boys&rsquo; bedrooms are open to God.</h2>
<p>It was while Samuel was asleep that God stood at his bedside;
but He is there before we sleep.&nbsp; He hears when wicked
stories are told, and when bad deeds are planned in the dark.</p>
<h2>III.&mdash;God does not wait for you to grow up before He
calls.</h2>
<p>Perhaps you have heard Him call and, like Samuel, did not know
the voice.&nbsp; When you felt that longing to be good, then He
called.&nbsp; When you were at the grave-side, and felt awed and
silenced by the coffin, thinking that some day people would look
down and read your name, He called.&nbsp; When you were ill and
felt unfit to die, He called.&nbsp; In your class at Sunday
school, and while hearing the gospel preached, you were
called.</p>
<h2>IV.&mdash;Boys should answer the first call.</h2>
<p>Samuel was not like some lads who have to be called many times
before they will get up.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ran unto
Eli.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>And in doing this he was the picture
of the way we should make haste, and delay not to keep
God&rsquo;s commandments.&nbsp; You will never be of greater
value to God than now.&nbsp; Each day you delay to serve Him, you
lessen your value in His sight.</p>
<h2>V.&mdash;Boys may be taken into God&rsquo;s confidence.</h2>
<p>The Bible tells us, &ldquo;The secret of the Lord is with them
that fear Him,&rdquo; and a boy may fear God so as to know His
secrets as Samuel did.&nbsp; If you will listen, as this lad did,
you shall hear God speak.</p>
<h2>VI.&mdash;Boys who do God&rsquo;s will shall have men do
their&rsquo;s.</h2>
<p>See verse 20.&nbsp; The whole nation came to hear the mind of
God from the boy-prophet, for we read in the first verse of the
next chapter that Samuel&rsquo;s word came unto all Israel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">If death can

<h2><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>L.&nbsp; THE BROKEN OAR.</h2>
<p>The other day, when the Oxford and Cambridge men were
contesting for the mastery, the Oxford boat was behind, but the
crew were not willing to admit they were beaten, and were making
great efforts to gain the day, when, all at once, the oar of the
best man in the boat broke in two, consequently all hope of
winning was gone.&nbsp; All the rest of the way there were only
seven oars, and the weight of the eighth man to carry as
well.</p>
<p>In musing over this, it struck us that there were several
lessons to be learned&mdash;lessons which the eye that used to
scan the race-ground would have made use of, if he were writing
an epistle in these days.</p>
<p>Is it not true that the dead weight in the boat hinders the
progress of the Church of God?&nbsp; Up and down the country we
hear of those who hinder the work&mdash;members of society, and
sometimes office-bearers, who if they were in heaven would help
more, or, at least, hinder less than they do now.&nbsp; If this
book should fall into the hands of any of these men, we wish they
would lay to heart the lesson, that if from any cause they are
not working, we have their weight to carry in addition, and that
we could get on better if they were not.&nbsp; As we write we are
thinking of one of these hinderers&mdash;smooth of tongue, and
sanctimonious in phraseology, who is helping the enemy of God by
hindering his servants.</p>
<p>This becomes all the more painful when these unfaithful men
are persons of power and influence.&nbsp; Some of them <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>were once very useful, and have wielded an influence
for good that was of immense use; but, alas! in an evil hour they
turned aside, and now retard the progress of what they once loved
to assist.&nbsp; We appeal to such of our readers as are doing
good service, that they pray to be kept from backsliding in
heart, lest their oars be broken, and they become a dead weight
in the boat.</p>
<p>Some of those who are with us, and yet not of us, are
accumulating wealth.&nbsp; We appeal to them to bear in mind that
their money makes them greater difficulties than ever, and that
the more their balance at the bankers&rsquo; grows the greater
their dead weight in the boat.&nbsp; If we could only get rid of
these people, how lightly the boat would spring forward!&nbsp;
Sometimes we are ready to wish that these men could lose their
money, they would then become manageable.</p>
<p>What is to be done?&nbsp; We cannot but think of Circuit after
Circuit where men of talent and influence are keeping the Church
of God from coming to the front.&nbsp; What a loss life is to
them!&nbsp; How much better if they had died in their useful
days!&nbsp; If they do not repent, what a hell awaits them!&nbsp;
How could such people enjoy heaven if they were sent there?&nbsp;
For them to behold the other part of the crew, who did their
duty, crowned for their faithfulness, must, as a matter of
course, make them reflect that their chances were the same, but
that they ceased to toil, and hindered those who would have
accomplished much for God but for their baneful presence.</p>
<p>There are other lessons we learned from this same boat-race,
to which we will refer at some other time.&nbsp; Suffice it that
for the present we pray,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
<span class="smcap">save us from Dead Weights</span>!</p>
<h2><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>LI.&nbsp; &ldquo;WHY COULD NOT WE
CAST HIM OUT?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>And a very sensible question, too.&nbsp; When men fail there
is a reason for it; but we cannot always find out what the reason
is.&nbsp; But these followers of Jesus, who had not been able to
cast out the deaf and dumb devil, asked their Master how it
was.&nbsp; He had given them to see that it was not impossible to
cast out even that sort, but <span class="smcap">they</span>
could not.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; It is worth our while to
know, for just now the Methodist people are not succeeding as
they wish to succeed, and we are inclined to think, for the same
reason that caused the disciples to fail.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">This kind goeth not out
but by prayer and fasting</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; What does this
mean, if not that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">men who love
ease must expect the devils to laugh them to scorn</span>?</p>
<p>If we are not prepared to fast, it does not matter how well we
do other things&mdash;not only abstain from food, or drink, or
tobacco, but from other things we like.&nbsp; We know some men
who would do well to fast from having their own way, and others
who would serve God if they would take a back seat now and then,
and let somebody else talk a bit.</p>
<p>But it is not to these men we address ourselves to-day.&nbsp;
It is to those who are trying to get as much ease and comfort out
of life we would speak.&nbsp; There are some of us who preach and
live by it, who might do more to earn our stipend.&nbsp; We fear
the Rev. Mephibosheth Neversweat is too
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; to read &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Joyful News</span>,&rdquo; and it is useless saying
much to him, or else we should like to ask him to remember that
the time is coming when he will be too <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>old to
work, and it may be then, when his eye is too dim to read his
newspaper, he may be compelled to read the proof-sheets of his
own biography&mdash;a book that will be published and read when
all the world be there to hear it.&nbsp; We pity him when in old
age he remembers mis-used opportunities of becoming a blessing to
his generation, or looks forward to the time when he must give
account of himself to God!</p>
<p>The reverend gentleman we have named has some cousins, who are
Local Preachers; and we should like to have a word with them
also.&nbsp; How about those village congregations that were
disappointed of a preacher?&nbsp; How about those stale and faded
sermons?&nbsp; We wish you would be persuaded to make a sermon
on&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Shake thyself from the
dust</span>,&rdquo; because there would be at least one penitent,
even before the sermon was preached.</p>
<p>However, what perhaps is needed most of all is that the
decrease in our numbers as Methodists should lead us to repent,
and do our first works.&nbsp; We should as a Church humble
ourselves before God, and that without delay.&nbsp; He waits to
be gracious.&nbsp; We must not lose heart.&nbsp; Let the
thousands of faithful workers among us remember that when the
disciples were baffled, Jesus was in the company of Moses and
Elijah; but He dismissed them that He might come to the help of
His people.&nbsp; Whatever he may be doing, we can catch His ear,
and bring Him to the rescue.&nbsp; He needs only that we should
cry to Him for help.&nbsp; We indulge the hope that when
Methodism learns that, in spite of all the earnest work done, we
have fewer people meeting in class than we had last year, there
will be a bowing before the Lord.&nbsp; Already we see signs of
blessing.&nbsp; There is a waking up to duty, and a longing for
purity, that can have but one result.&nbsp; The Master is coming,
and shall soon say,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Being
him unto me</span>.&rdquo;</p>

they had been grateful they would have said, &ldquo;The God who
brought us out of Egypt, and through the Red Sea, will not allow
us to die of hunger.&rdquo;&nbsp; But instead of this they
accused Moses of being a murderer.&nbsp; And in answer to this
God said, &ldquo;I will rain bread from heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
an illustration of Romans v. 8.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;Manna like salvation, because it saved the people
from perishing.</h3>
<p>Nothing else would have done in its place.&nbsp; The people
had jewels, but they could not eat them!&nbsp; They had
instruments of music, but they could not live on sound!&nbsp;
Nothing else but Jesus can save the soul from famine.&nbsp;
Sinner, ask thyself the question of Isaiah li. 2.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;Manna like salvation, because it was

grow on trees, but on the ground.&nbsp; Some are too proud to be

<p>We read that when Peter was in the prison the angel smote him
on the side, and raised him up.&nbsp; But He smote Herod, and he
was</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">eaten of
worms</span>,</p>
<p>and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>Mark the difference between the blows the Lord strikes His own
people and His foes.&nbsp; He smites us, and then lifts us up; He
smites his enemies, and then casts them down for ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Which are
you</span>?</p>
<p>Herod was one of those who gave not God the glory: he was for
having the glory himself.&nbsp; Those of us who preach had better
be aware that when the people praise us we may fall into
Herod&rsquo;s sin, and take God&rsquo;s glory to ourselves.&nbsp;
This is a dangerous game to play, and many a man has been eaten
by the worm of envy and shame because he allowed the people to
make an idol of him, until they saw another bigger idol than
himself.&nbsp; Nor was this all.&nbsp; Some preachers have gone
where the worm dieth not, because they gave not God the
glory.</p>
<p>Better far be in jail for Jesus than sitting on a throne, if
we are not on the right side.&nbsp; If you are one of God&rsquo;s
friends, fear nothing; but if you are one of His foes, you do
well to fear everything, for you might, like Herod, have to sink
from magnificence to loathsomeness, and know death before you
die.</p>
<h2><!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>LIV.&nbsp; THE FAN.<br />
<span class="smcap">Matthew</span> iii. 12.</h2>
<p>Do you think John the Baptist knew anything about it?&nbsp; Do
you think he was capable of understanding and appreciating Jesus
Christ?&nbsp; Because if so, Jesus Christ has two sides.&nbsp;
There is the barn for the wheat, and there is a <i>fire for the
chaff</i>.&nbsp; And Jesus Christ is the great Destroyer as well
as the great Saviour.&nbsp; The same voice that says, &ldquo;Come
to Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest,&rdquo; shall say some day, &ldquo;Depart from Me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Jesus Christ is the great Destroyer.&nbsp; Now this is
the age of the fan.&nbsp; In all times of history there has never
been a time like this, when God puts things to the test, and
proves them; and everything in this world to-day is on its trial,
and if it is not sixteen ounces to the pound it will go.&nbsp; I
do not care whether it is a king&rsquo;s crown, a bishop&rsquo;s
mitre, or a parson&rsquo;s white tie, it will have to go if it is
not right.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose fan is in His hand, and He will
thoroughly purge His floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where is Babylon?&nbsp; The greatest heap of dirt in the world
is Babylon!&nbsp; Where is Spain&mdash;Spain, that used to make
Englishmen tremble?&nbsp; It is nothing; it does not count; it is
not put as a cypher in the world&rsquo;s sum.&nbsp; What is
Napoleon?&nbsp; Eh! what is Napoleon?&nbsp; The last of the
Napoleons died under the hand of a savage when he was where he
had no business to be, burning his lips with other folks&rsquo;
broth.&nbsp; The grandest bit of human nature in this <!-- page
143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>world, a few years ago, was the Emperor who has just
gone to heaven.&nbsp; The grandest man I ever saw.&nbsp; I never
saw what God Almighty could make of flesh and blood until I saw
him.&nbsp; And he has left behind him a man with one arm; the
other arm is a sword-arm.&nbsp; The Emperor Frederick said that
he wanted to live for peace.&nbsp; I wish our princes were more
like him.&nbsp; I have been told that I must not say anything
about the Prince of Wales.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;God save the
Queen&rdquo;; she is the best monarch that ever sat on the
throne.&nbsp; God bless her, and may she live longer than any of
them ever have done.&nbsp; And I say, &ldquo;God save the Prince
of Wales,&rdquo; for racehorses will not save him; gambling will
not save him.&nbsp; The man that is to come to the throne owns
racehorses; he has a horse called &ldquo;Mischief,&rdquo; and it
is well called.&nbsp; Why must I keep silent when I see the first
man in the realm encouraging that which is ruining our young men,
and sometimes sending them to a felon&rsquo;s prison?&nbsp; I
believe a limited monarchy is the best form of government that
can be found for England, but the English crown is on its trial,
and if it is not wheat, there are dark days in store for
England.&nbsp; I want to see the present style of government, and
I want a man on the throne that <i>is</i> a man, and not one that
is trying as hard as he can to set such an example as will send
the country to hell.&nbsp; I would like the chance of saying it
to his face.&nbsp; You can tell people what I have said.&nbsp;
Let us thank God that the fan is in the hand of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>You cannot keep Methodism from the action of the fan.&nbsp; It
has got to be tried, and everything in Methodism that is not
wheat will go into the fire, and serve it right.&nbsp; Everything
must be sown, and must grow and bear its fruit, and be gathered,
and then winnowed; and the chaff <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>must go
into the fire.&nbsp; The Methodist pulpit is not an exception to
it.&nbsp; If I cannot interest people I have no right to be paid
for it.&nbsp; If I cannot get the people to come and hear me, and
if I do not go and look after them in their homes, I have no
right to draw the money for doing it.&nbsp; And no preacher has
the right to think that people should come and hear him if he
cannot preach&mdash;he has no right.&nbsp; I am tired out when I
think of the things that put themselves where they have no
right.</p>
<p>The whole Christian Church to-day has got to come under the
fan; and there will be some wonderful changes before all your
heads are grey.&nbsp; The grandest thing is that Jesus Christ
holds the fan.</p>
<p>The class-meeting is on its trial.</p>
<p>I do not believe in a class-leader that does not lead, that is
not first.&nbsp; I do not believe in a man&rsquo;s right to be
counted a leader because his name is at the top of the
book.&nbsp; I know classes, and you know classes, where, if you
have a revival, and get twenty new members in the class, they
will attend it about once or twice, and after that, if you rub
the cypher out, that will stand for the increase.&nbsp; That
&ldquo;leader&rdquo; is guaranteed to lose everybody that is in
his class, except two or three dear people, and they can keep the
meeting on for an hour; and be as dreary as&mdash;well, I will
not say <i>all</i> that is in my mind.&nbsp; You see, some people
would say it is no business of mine.&nbsp; But no man has a right
to be a leader if he cannot keep a meeting all alive.&nbsp; If a
man can get a class of 150 to 200 people to listen to him when he
speaks, that is the man to lead.&nbsp; You must not sacrifice the
new-born babes.&nbsp; I do not know what the Committee that has
been sitting on &ldquo;the class meeting&rdquo; thought about it,
but depend upon it, it will <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>have to
come under the fan.&nbsp; I know places where a man&rsquo;s name
is kept on the class-book because he condescends to pay the
minister for his ticket whenever he calls, and where another man
is taken off that cannot afford it.&nbsp; Why, John Bunyan would
have called that damnable!</p>
<p>The chaff is no good.&nbsp; You may plant chaff in the best
land that ever was, and you will not get anything.&nbsp; That
which is of no use must go into the fire.</p>
<p>The Sunday-school is on its trial.&nbsp; Yes! even in
Lancashire.&nbsp; The biggest Sunday-school system is here in
this county.&nbsp; What is the result?&nbsp; What has it to show,
compared with the amount of patient, faithful work that has been
done?&nbsp; Do you not think that in some places the result is
all chaff?&nbsp; The Sunday-school is fast becoming the grandest
entertainment agency in existence, and places that were built for
the teaching of God&rsquo;s Word are now places for
entertainment, better than any theatre, because they cost
nothing.&nbsp; I saw in Leeds, the other Sunday, that in a
certain Sunday-school &ldquo;there will be a <i>sacred drama</i>
rendered.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was not a Methodist School.&nbsp; But I
know schools where they have &ldquo;niggers,&rdquo; with
blackened faces and banjos.&nbsp; The &ldquo;nigger troupe of
such-and-such a school!&rdquo;&nbsp; What do you think John
Wesley would say if he came to life again?&nbsp; He would drive
them out, as Christ drove out those men from the Temple,
&ldquo;with a whip of&rdquo;&mdash;well!&nbsp; I do not think
they would be such &ldquo;small cords&rdquo; either.</p>
<p>Now the Sunday-school, &ldquo;the greatest thing of this
age,&rdquo; the grandest thing that the Church has seen in the
last hundred years, is on its trial: and if we do not mind it
will go with the chaff into the unquenchable fire.&nbsp; We
cannot <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>play into the devil&rsquo;s hands
without getting what he will get some day.&nbsp; Now I am talking
here to you to-day for the last time.&nbsp; There will be no
services here until after the Conference.&nbsp; There may be some
poor, unsaved man here.&nbsp; God can make wheat out of
chaff.&nbsp; He can!&nbsp; He will if you will come to Him.&nbsp;
He will change your life, and you that are nothing worth, He can
make you fit for heavenly thrones.</p>
<p>Listen to this letter.&nbsp; The man that wrote it was a
football player.&nbsp; He was in the Bolton Wanderers, in its day
a crack club.&nbsp; He was also a singer in the choir.&nbsp; And
he came to a chapel where I was conducting a mission; and this
little word got hold of him.&nbsp; It was not any great thing
that was said; for it is sometimes &ldquo;on boards and broken
pieces of the ship that they come to land.&rdquo;&nbsp; This poor
lad heard me say this:&mdash;&ldquo;You singers!&rdquo;&mdash;I
did not know he was there&mdash;&ldquo;You singers!&nbsp; If you
die out of Christ, when you get into the bottomless pit, some of
the wicked spirits will come to torment you: &lsquo;Sing us a
solo!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It got him on his knees.&nbsp; He
became penitent, and through giving his heart to God he is an
evangelist in that town now.&nbsp; He was only chaff, though a
wonderful player in the field; and he that used to say,
&ldquo;Play up, Jim!&rdquo; has grown into a man, and the devil
hates him now!&nbsp; He writes:&mdash;&ldquo;I feel drawn out to
write to you.&nbsp; Many souls are being saved nearly every
day.&nbsp; A man got saved some weeks back; and we went to see
how he was going on.&nbsp; He first came to the mission, and
although convinced of his wicked life, he refused the offer of
mercy.&nbsp; Not being able to rest, he again found his way to
the mission-hall, and there he found the Saviour.&nbsp; A few
weeks passed, and I went to find him out.&nbsp; When we got
there, they asked us in.&nbsp; I did not see a picture on the
wall, only a few almanacks; but they had <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>some bonny
children, and the floor was very clean, and the fireplace
bright.&nbsp; They had not many friends coming to see them.&nbsp;
The father, having changed his pit clothes, came
downstairs.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;My wife used to pray when I
married her, but I broke her up.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, pointing
to the five children, he said, &lsquo;Thank God!&nbsp; Instead of
being cursed to-night, they will all kneel down!&nbsp; The eldest
girl is thirteen, and next Saturday I have got money to buy her a
new frock, and on the Sunday she shall go to the Sunday school
for the first time.&nbsp; Sometimes I pick up one of the
children, and say, &lsquo;God bless thee, my child; thou wilt not
have to fetch me from the ale-house any more!&rsquo;&nbsp; After
he had told us of his changed life, we all knelt down and thanked
God.&nbsp; Last night his wife went home rejoicing in the
Gospel.&mdash;Your son in the Gospel, <span class="smcap">James
Atherton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That poor man was chaff.&nbsp; And you, wherever you are, you
may be just about to be carried away.&nbsp; Cry to God!&nbsp;
This is my last word&mdash;Poor chaff, cry to God!&nbsp; And He
will make thee wheat that shall command a rare price.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 148</span>LV.&nbsp; &ldquo;THE KING KISSED
BARZILLAI.&rdquo;<br />
2 <span class="smcap">Sam.</span> xix. 39.</h2>
<p>And no wonder, for David could appreciate a real man when he
saw him, and so does David&rsquo;s Lord.</p>
<p>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Loyalty is precious to the King
of Kings</span>.</p>
<p>In the days when the son of Jesse had but few friends, it was
a precious thing to be treated in the style Barzillai and his
neighbours entertained him (see 2 Sam. xvii. 27-29).&nbsp; They
were rich farmers, and had land which brought forth with
abundance, so were able to act with princely hospitality to the
fugitive monarch.&nbsp; But plenty may live with avarice, and
when that is the case it is not to be expected that men who are
fleeing for their lives will be received with kind
generosity.&nbsp; In this case, however, the sight of the needy
soldiers made the hearts of those kingly farmers beat with
sympathy, and so the provisions were put there for the men to
help themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hungry, weary, and thirsty&rdquo;
were they, but their hospitable entertainers made them
welcome.&nbsp; Never would those dust-covered soldiers forget the
halt they made in those green fields.</p>
<p>None felt, though, as David did.&nbsp; He had seen one trusted
friend after another fall away, and the thought that the chief
among the rebels was his own beloved son pierced him to the
heart.&nbsp; It was then he composed the fourth Psalm.&nbsp; And
just then to have this welcome feast must have cheered his soul
even more than his body.</p>
<p>Do you live among those who are the enemies of David&rsquo;s
greater Son?&nbsp; Is Jesus in a minority?&nbsp; Are there those
<!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>who work with you who delight in making assaults upon
your faith?&nbsp; Do they insult your God?&nbsp; Stand up for
Jesus!&nbsp; Be faithful when others are recreant or
hostile.&nbsp; A working man the other day, who has to win his
bread among those who hate the name of God, and who profane the
air with their blasphemies, said to one who was cursing,
&ldquo;Draw it mild there, that&rsquo;s the name of my best
friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us play the man even though we be
alone.&nbsp; What did Barzillai care for Absalom&rsquo;s
popularity?&nbsp; David is my king, and he shall have the best I
have: Sooner or later the king will have the opportunity of
rewarding the faithful.&nbsp; The king kissed Barzillai when
parting from him; he had pressed his friend to go back with him
to Jerusalem, but</p>
<p>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">We see a beautiful illustration
of contentment</span>.&mdash;They had come down together after
the great battle, and David said, &ldquo;Come thou over with me,
and I will feed thee with me at Jerusalem.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
worthy of them both, and we cannot but feel touched at
David&rsquo;s gratitude; he would fain have the patriarch spend
his last days with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;With me,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I will see thou hast everything thou canst
want.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I
will see thee safely over the river, and then I will return to
the green fields I love, and when the time comes for me to die I
will be laid by the side of my father and my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When will men learn that it is not their surroundings but
themselves that make a place comfortable or not?&nbsp; Paul could
say, &ldquo;I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to
be content,&rdquo; and he said this in a letter he wrote to the
town where he had sung praises in the jail!&nbsp; Some people
would have jumped to have had this chance of going to live in a
palace, but this farmer said, &ldquo;Give me my farmhouse and my
quiet grave beside my mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Elevation
may undo us.&nbsp; A sparrow could only chirp even though in a
golden cage.&nbsp; Barzillai felt, &ldquo;A rustic, like I am,
seems all right among my ploughs and cattle, but I should not fit
a palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many a man has made himself a laughing
stock because he left the place he was fitted for, and so looked
like a dandelion in a conservatory.</p>
<p>III.&mdash;We have in Barzillai&rsquo;s words <span
class="smcap">an old man&rsquo;s view of earthly
enjoyment</span>.&nbsp; As though he had said, &ldquo;I have lost
hearing, sight, and taste; what are all these things to me?&nbsp;
I am soon to be in my grave, what do I want away from
home?&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be well for most of us to weigh these
words, &ldquo;How long have I to live?&rdquo;&nbsp; To judge from
the way we see men toil to get houses and land, you would think
they were going to live for ever.&nbsp; Watch them how they are
scraping the money they have; they have none to spare to feed the
hungry and clothe the naked; they have poor relatives, but they
cannot help them.&nbsp; Are they not going to be rich, live in a
splendid house, be grand folks some day?&nbsp; Aye, but death
cannot be bribed.&nbsp; I was passing through a splendid estate
the other day, and was told of the gentleman that owns it; he is
an old man, but he will not own to it, and he is quite a fraud,
with his dyed hair and wrinkled face; he looks quite ghastly, in
spite of all that art can do to pad him and make him up.&nbsp; I
wish some of those who are denying themselves the luxury of
giving, because they have determined to have a splendid estate
for their children, would think &ldquo;How will my mansion look
with the blinds down, and a hearse at the door with a coffin in
it, with my name on a silver plate?&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot refuse
to help the poor, and hear Jesus say, &ldquo;Well
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; We cannot save money for selfish purposes and
go to heaven.&nbsp; Besides, to leave riches for those who come
after us is the way to have dry eyes at our funeral!</p>
<p><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Those who are loyal shall
win promotion for their children</span>.&mdash;Although Barzillai
was not willing to go to live in Jerusalem, he felt that his son
might enjoy it, and so called the king&rsquo;s attention to
Chimham.&nbsp; Let him go over with my lord the king.&nbsp; He is
not too old to bend.&nbsp; He can adapt himself.&nbsp; There
would be many questions asked by those who had not left the
palace when the king returned, as to who this rustic was who was
in the palace of David, and they would be told, &ldquo;This is
the son of Barzillai.&nbsp; His father was a faithful friend when
friends were few, and his son is promoted to dwell with the
king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When David gave his dying charge to Solomon, he said,
&ldquo;Show kindness to the sons of Barzillai&rdquo; (1 Kings
ii., 7).&nbsp; Tears had passed since he saw the provision made
for him and his men, but he could never forget it.&nbsp; On his
deathbed he could see the bed that was placed by the road side,
and upon which he had rested his weary limbs when a fugutive, and
so he would repay his debt to the children of the aged
farmer.&nbsp; How true it is that we can make futurity our
servant and the servant of our children by at the present time
caring for our King.&nbsp; Does God see that we stand by His
cause when it is weak?&nbsp; Do we find food and comfort for His
fainting soldiers?&nbsp; Then he shows His appreciation by
inviting us to Jerusalem the golden.&nbsp; We shall not wish to
excuse ourselves from going to that blessed spot.&nbsp; Be we
young or be we old, we shall not wish to return, but shall go on
to find that the singing men and singing women wish us to join
their number and to help them in praising the King, immortal,
invisible, to whom be glory and honour for ever.</p>
<h2><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>LVI.&nbsp; &ldquo;THEN THE FIRE OF
THE LORD FELL.&rdquo;<br />
1 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> xviii. 38.</h2>
<p>It was fire that came direct from heaven.&nbsp; It was not the
first time it had fallen; we read of it in Leviticus ix. 24 as
coming from before the Lord, and consuming the sacrifice.&nbsp;
It was God&rsquo;s way of showing His power and his favour, and
it was something that could neither be imitated nor produced by
anyone else besides Jehovah.</p>
<p>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">This fire came at a time of
apostacy</span>.&nbsp; The nation, headed by King Ahab, had gone
very far away from God.&nbsp; They needed some signal display of
God&rsquo;s power to win them back again.&nbsp; It is interesting
to notice that God has been in the habit of manifesting Himself
in a remarkable way just at the time when his foes seem to be
triumphing.&nbsp; The religion of Jehovah was almost forgotten,
the rites of unclean idols were popular both in court and
cottage, and it was then that the word of the Lord came to
Elijah.&nbsp; When Satan can produce Ahab, God can assert Himself
by raising up the seer who shall put him to shame.&nbsp; Has it
not been so many times since?&nbsp; When the rulers had put Jesus
to death, He proved His resurrection by sending tongues of fire
on those who kept His word by remaining at Jerusalem.&nbsp; When
Popery had placed its iron heel upon the head of Gospel truth,
Martin Luther was converted; and later on, when a cold rigour was
upon Christendom, Wesley and Whitefield felt the fire of God in
their very bones, and were sent out to tell of the Jesus that
delivers the vilest of men.</p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>May we not expect in these days of blasphemy and rebuke
that the fire shall fall upon the Church, and that some shall be
so filled with the Holy Ghost that the enemies of God shall be
delivered to derision and contempt?&nbsp; Let us not be dismayed
by the power and number of those who are arrayed against
us.&nbsp; <i>Elijah was in a minority of one</i>.&nbsp; He had
the king and queen against him; hundreds of well-fed priests
opposed him; the whole nation had turned its back on God, and
were opposed to this single-handed prophet.&nbsp; If the fire did
not fall, he would become their victim; but they could not
prevent the fire coming from heaven.&nbsp; It is the unseen
forces that are to be dreaded by the enemies of God.&nbsp; There
was no sign of this fire; but there was a needs-be that Jehovah
should prove his supremacy, and He did it unmistakably, for the
fire of God fell!</p>
<p>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The fire was something
Baal&rsquo;s priests could not produce</span>.&mdash;The Creator
has a pre-emption on His universe.&nbsp; He has not given the key
of His treasury to any man or angel.&nbsp; Those heathen priests
may have been&mdash;some of them doubtless
were&mdash;sincere.&nbsp; They had cried unto Baal for help; they
had implored his assistance; but neither the deaf idol nor the
listening devil who had invented idolatry could reach the source
of the flame which was to come, but not in reply to their
desire.</p>
<p>It is well for us who are sometimes in perplexity because of
the power of evil to look at the helplessness of sin when in
extremity.&nbsp; These shrieking priests of Baal are a picture of
many a one since, who has cried for help and had no reply.&nbsp;
Let the cholera come a little nearer our shores.&nbsp; As I write
these words I hear it is in Spain; it may be in London before
this is printed.&nbsp; There may be in the <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>printing-office some infidel compositor, but though he
sneers at religion and those who believe the Bible, he cannot
keep away from the pestilence as silently it steals along the
street where he sleeps!&nbsp; The cholera would drive infidelity
away from many a scoffer were it but to slay a few hundreds of
Englishmen.&nbsp; How powerless are God&rsquo;s foes at such a
time!</p>
<p>Should there come a universal drought that meant famine if
there were not showers to come copious and lasting, how many
would look up to God who now never think of Him!&nbsp; What could
science and skill do for us when rain is needed?&nbsp; A famine
would make Bradlaugh very unpopular.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the God of
the Christians does not help us by sending rain, what can we do
but starve,&rdquo; would be the cry.&nbsp; These prophets cutting
themselves and howling their own shame supply a picture of the
powerlessness of sin when confronted with necessity.</p>
<p>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The fire fell in answer to
prayer</span>.&nbsp; What a scene is depicted in verses 29 and
30!&nbsp; There were neither voice nor any to answer, nor any
that regarded, and Elijah said, &ldquo;Yes, if we are on the side
of God and righteousness we can afford to wait.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There will be a time when even those who have opposed us shall
long to see us act.&nbsp; The prophet waited for his turn, and it
came.&nbsp; How the priests would watch him as he repaired the
broken and neglected altar of God?&nbsp; Digging a trench round
the stones he had piled, and then laying the bullock on the wood,
he sent down to the shore for water, which he continued to pour
on the sacrifice till it had filled the trench.&nbsp; Ah! if the
fire can consume that, it is no trick.&nbsp; Those who live as
near to God as Elijah did, can get fire enough to conquer all His
opponents, and need not fear the issue.</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>And now he is about to pray.&nbsp; How all would listen
as each word smote upon their ears.&nbsp; He puts God to the
proof, and asks Him to show who is master, Baal or Jehovah.&nbsp;
Do we not need more of this kind of prayer?&nbsp; Would there not
be more of it if there was only greater faith?&nbsp; Who is the
God we serve?&nbsp; Have we Elijah&rsquo;s Lord to cry
unto?&nbsp; Then how is it we allow the servants of Baal to
triumph over us?&nbsp; Prayer is as great a power to-day as it
ever was, if only we have faith in Him who tells us,
&ldquo;Knock, and the door shall be opened.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dare we
put Him to the test, and ask for that which is sure to bring
glory to Him, feeling that if our prayers are not answered it is
God&rsquo;s name that will be dishonoured more than ours?&nbsp;
Whenever Christians come up to this standard they will prevail in
prayer, and be able to call down celestial fire.&nbsp; Pentecost
will repeat itself whenever the whole Church will wait on the
Lord, as the early Christians did, with one accord.&nbsp; To
believe otherwise is to reckon that God has no care either for
His glory or for a perishing world.</p>
<p>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The fire conquered all
opposition</span>.&nbsp; The physical difficulties were as
nothing, it consumed and licked up all.&nbsp; Flesh, stone, wood,
and water alike were wrapped in flame, and appeared no
more.&nbsp; Difficulties are fuel to the heaven-sent fire!&nbsp;
Opposition is opportunity to omnipotence.&nbsp; Does not the
history of the Church teach this over and over again?&nbsp; The
Israelites crossed the Red Sea &ldquo;By crystal walls
protected.&rdquo;&nbsp; The three Hebrew children &ldquo;walked
unburned in fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do not let us be afraid of
physical or spiritual difficulties if there is a promise or
command.</p>
<p>The prophet wished to have his countrymen converted, <!-- page
156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>and prayed that their hearts might be turned back, and
this miracle convinced them that Jehovah &ldquo;was alone among
the gods, that all their idols were as nothing before Him.&nbsp;
And what is wanted to bring about moral victories is the fire
from above, the same fire that fell at Pentecost, tongues of
fire, whether we shall see them or not; the people must feel our
words to burn them if we have the heaven-sent fire.&nbsp; Nothing
will save England and the world but this, and do we not read,
&ldquo;Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he
prayed earnestly?&nbsp; Why should not future writers say Jones
or Robinson, or whatever your name is, was a man, and he prayed,
and there was a mighty revival?</p>
<p>All opposition will fall before the fire.&nbsp; Neither
Sacerdotalism nor Atheism can hold its ground before the
celestial burnings.&nbsp; What the enemies of Jesus have to fear
is for the Church to fall upon its knees.&nbsp; Those who bow
before the Lord can stand upright in the presence of His
enemies.&nbsp; The man who, later on in this chapter, we are told
cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his
knees when he prayed, was wont to say, &ldquo;As the Lord God
liveth before whom I stand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us only be mighty in
prayer, and we shall be mighty enough to make wicked men
tremble.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He who can win favour in
prayer can win victory in battle</span>.</p>

CONVERSION.<br />
2 <span class="smcap">Kings</span> ii. 19-22.</h2>
<p>Are not the stories of the Old Testament the parables of the
Holy Ghost?&nbsp; Jesus taught by parables; and the Holy Ghost,
the Divine Teacher, who yet leads into all truth, has stored
doctrine in these tales.&nbsp; There is a kernel inside the
shell, if only we have the teeth to crack it.</p>
<p>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">We have a picture of an
Unregenerate Heart</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The water is naught</i>,&rdquo; said the men of the
city.&nbsp; Does not that describe many a life?&nbsp; Naughty
actions influence for evil; for wherever these waters flowed they
carried desolation.&nbsp; The fields through which the river ran
were useless to the farmer.&nbsp; Are there not some whom we know
who might be thus described&mdash;perhaps someone who reads these
lines among the number?&nbsp; First the schoolboy, then the
youth, and now the man, profitless and sour, so that all
cultivation has been wasted.&nbsp; Is it so?</p>
<p>And, what makes the disappointment the greater, &ldquo;the
situation is pleasant.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is just the place where
men like to build.&nbsp; Everything looks so promising.&nbsp; How
true this of many in our midst!&nbsp; Have we not heard some
father say, when his boy&rsquo;s beauty has been praised,
&ldquo;<i>If he were only as good as he looks</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Is this so with those who are my audience?&nbsp; Is there this
combination of beauty and bitterness&mdash;men who are courageous
but proud, women that are beautiful but vain, workmen that are
industrious but covetous, others who are amiable but
intemperate&mdash;servant girls who are wonderfully clean and
active but have a dreadful temper?</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>Now, it is well for us to learn that we shall no more
cure ourselves than the land around Jericho could bring good
crops so long as the water was bad.&nbsp; Education and other
appliances are sure to fail.&nbsp; I dare say the people had
tried one sort of cultivation after another, and had dressed the
land with different appliances; but all had failed; there was no
hope of success.&nbsp; Very likely some of you are disgusted that
hitherto there has been no improvement.&nbsp; There are times
when you have really longed to be better, but there has been
nothing in yourself to give you hope.&nbsp; Now what shall be
done?&nbsp; Are we to remain as we are?&nbsp; Or shall we, like
the men of Jericho, seek help from One who delights to make the
barren fruitful, and to make the wilderness glad?&nbsp; This
brings me to consider:&mdash;</p>
<p>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">How to Cure a Sinful
Heart</span>; <span class="smcap">or</span>, <span
class="smcap">a Picture of True Conversion</span>.</p>
<p>The beginning of better days was when Elisha came to
Jericho.&nbsp; The farmers did not lose a chance.&nbsp; They
would not allow the prophet to leave them without having a proof
of his skill.&nbsp; They told him their trouble, and this was all
he needed.&nbsp; Doubtless he as a farmer&rsquo;s son saw the
barren fields, and sympathised with them.&nbsp; And does not
Jesus look at us with pity?&nbsp; Is he not waiting to save
now?&nbsp; But he will not save where desire does not turn to
prayer.&nbsp; If the men of Jericho had left the matter where it
was they would still have had to suffer loss, but they stirred
themselves to call on one who was mighty to deliver.&nbsp; Is not
this the secret?&nbsp; Are not some of us profitless and barren
because we are too indolent to pray?</p>
<p>But let us pause a moment to consider what a lesson there is
here to the pulpit.&nbsp; Elisha said, &ldquo;<i>Bring me a new
cruse</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dish did not cure the waters, but it
had to be used, and therefore must be clean!&nbsp; God is pleased
<!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>to use human beings as the instruments of
conversion.&nbsp; As the prophet needed something to contain the
healing salt, so preachers and teachers convey the saving
truth.&nbsp; We have no description of the dish, as to its shape
or colour; but being new, it was undefiled.&nbsp; We have this
treasure in earthen vessels, and if we are to be useful, we had
better be cracked, if clean, than entire, but vile.</p>
<p>Mark you, preacher, it is not enough that you are a cruse; you
must be filled with that which heals.&nbsp; Have we salt?&nbsp;
It is not a question as to the quality or style of pottery; it is
salt that is needed.&nbsp; A common flower-pot filled with salt
was better than a vase of classic mould if empty!</p>
<p>Elisha did not waste time by trying to heal the stream.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He went forth <span class="smcap">to the
spring</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; What expense and trouble are thrown
away by vain attempts to heal the water lower down!&nbsp; We
shall never succeed in keeping the tongue from bitter words if
the heart is left to itself.&nbsp; It is useless for men to think
blue ribbon will save them from drink if they do not look to God
to take the selfishness out of the heart.&nbsp; It is a wise
prayer, &ldquo;Cleanse Thou the thoughts of our heart by the
inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it not strange
that men do not see that an impure fountain cannot be cleansed by
either altering the course of the stream or using remedies lower
down?</p>
<p>III.&mdash;And then we have <span class="smcap">the results of
conversion</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>The waters were
healed</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark you, the prophet took care there
should be no mistake as to the cause.&nbsp; It was neither he,
nor the cruse, nor the salt: &ldquo;<i>Thus saith the Lord</i>,
<i>I have healed these waters</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It shall
be to the Lord for a name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the crown be on the
Head.&nbsp; So the waters were healed.&nbsp; What a change in a
short time!&nbsp; But the results would not be seen all at once;
it would take time to prove the <i>realness</i> <!-- page
160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>of
the change, yet each season would only prove the grand conversion
that had happened.&nbsp; If we have received Christ into our
hearts, the results will be shown; and there are no evidences of
Christianity better than these true conversions, which change a
man&rsquo;s life, and make it evident that he, like the fields
around Jericho, has passed from death unto life.&nbsp; The other
day, a Lancashire coal-miner was killed in the pit; only a minute
before he was killed he was overheard praising God.&nbsp; He had
been a sad drunkard; his home was wretchedness itself.&nbsp;
Money was in his hands only helpful to hellish enjoyment.&nbsp;
But the grace of God changed his heart and life.&nbsp; His home
and family were soon made happy.&nbsp; He became a preacher, went
about from village to village testifying of God&rsquo;s saving
grace.&nbsp; In one place he said: &ldquo;When I was here last, I
won &pound;20 by jumping, but my wife and children were no better
for it; the publican got it all, and I was locked up into the
bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was buried with every sign of respect;
hundreds followed him to the grave, and everyone felt that the
world was the poorer now that he was gone.&nbsp; These are the
evidences we want; these proofs of the truth of the Bible close
the mouth of the infidel and scorner.&nbsp; If you would help on
the cause of Christianity, love the truth, and make the fields,
once barren, bloom with beauty; so shall the name of the Lord be
magnified.&nbsp; Shall we not all join in Charles Wesley&rsquo;s
prayer?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Jesus, Thy salvation bring,<br />
Cast the salt into the spring,<br />
In my heart Thy love reveal,<br />
Nature&rsquo;s bitter waters heal;<br />
Let the principles of grace<br />
Bring forth fruits of righteousness:<br />
Then the barren curse is o&rsquo;er,<br />
Sin and death are then no more.</p>

<h2><!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>LVIII.&nbsp; THE FIRST LIE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Ye shall not surely
die</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Genesis</span> iii.
4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Who was the First
Liar</span>?</p>
<p>The old serpent, the devil, called elsewhere &ldquo;the father
of lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he had not always been a liar; he had
fallen from a position very eminent, teaching us not to measure
our safety by our condition.&nbsp; The higher we are elevated,
the more dreadful the fall.&nbsp; Some of the most degraded
vagrants were cradled in comfort, and have wandered from homes of
splendour.&nbsp; Perhaps the vilest of the vile once were
ministers of the Gospel.&nbsp; In a village, the other day, I was
told of a man, once a Sunday-school teacher, but now a
professional gambler, and, in a coal-pit I know in the North of
England, the foulest-mouthed blasphemer was once a Methodist
local preacher.</p>
<p>Who would have expected that one of God&rsquo;s angels would
ever have turned tempter, and that one who had lived with God
would have the bottomless pit dug for him and his
companions?&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him that thinketh he standeth take
heed lest he fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How skilfully this lie was told!&nbsp; It was not to Adam the
serpent spoke; he was not cheated (1 Tim. ii. 14.)&nbsp; It would
have been useless to have spoken to him on the subject; but Eve
had not heard the commandment.&nbsp; It would be well if, when we
are tempted, we said, &ldquo;Why do you come to me?&nbsp; Is
there no one else who understands this question more than I
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; If Eve had only thought, &ldquo;Why is not my
husband spoken to first?&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps she <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>was glad to accept responsibility she had no right
to.&nbsp; Was ambition possible to her?&nbsp; We often see that
evil succeeds by using that to pave the way.&nbsp; Lies do not
overcome when contentment rules in Eden, but ambition is an
incipient hell!</p>
<p>Satan has not ceased to lie.&nbsp; He does not improve with
old age!&nbsp; He still seeks whom he may devour.&nbsp; The most
popular lie ever told is at present deceiving many of those who
little think where their ideas were born.&nbsp; It is said over
and over again in many circles that God will not punish
sin.&nbsp; What is this but giving the Divine Being the
lie?&nbsp; And there are some ministers who have taken upon them
to contradict the Bible, and try to persuade their hearers, who
too often want but little persuasion, that we may hope when God
has said &ldquo;Despair!&rdquo;&nbsp; What is this but hatching
the old serpent&rsquo;s eggs in the pulpit?</p>
<p>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">What were the Results of this
Lie</span>?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; They are very numerous, and we can only find space to
say a few words on each.&nbsp; There was <i>guiltiness</i>.&nbsp;
Eve believed the devil instead of God, and took the forbidden
fruit, making herself a sinner.&nbsp; Her excuse was, &ldquo;The
serpent beguiled me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she coveted that which God
kept back.&nbsp; How many Edens are lost because we desire that
which is forbidden!&nbsp; Is not this the spring of the so-called
social evil?&nbsp; We may say what we like against seduction, and
our words cannot be too strong, but the woman desiring when God
had said, &ldquo;Thou shalt not,&rdquo; is the true reason of
many falls.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The next step downwards is the tempting of another
and a loved one.&nbsp; Sometimes we have found ourselves wishing
Eve had died with the fruit in her mouth, instead of living to do
the devil&rsquo;s work, and lure her loved husband <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>to
the same ruin.&nbsp; Let me say here and with all emphasis,
<i>Never fear so much as when the hand of affection offers you
that which God forbids</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Now comes Death.&nbsp; The parents of the human race
were separated from God.&nbsp; Environment is a condition of
life.&nbsp; They have learned to do evil, they have to share the
lot of those who had not kept their first estate.&nbsp; Heaven
was an impossible climate to the apostate angels, and Eden was
only possible to those who obey.&nbsp; It is easy to see that the
garden was not now Paradise.&nbsp; Adam and his wife hid
themselves among the trees from the presence of the Lord!&nbsp;
Those trees were not created for that purpose.&nbsp; Alas for
sin! it poisons food and taints air.&nbsp; We cannot insist upon
this with too much force.&nbsp; It was true then as now.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He that believeth not shall not see life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Adam and Eve were poisoned by the forbidden fruit.&nbsp; Is it
not yet true that Innocence, Chastity, Modesty, are dead in some
who are thought to live?&nbsp; We wonder afterwards to see them
cast out, but it is, after all, the separation of the dead from
the living.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And now comes Suffering.&nbsp; They must hear the
curse pronounced, and then depart into the world which has begun
to grow thorns for them.&nbsp; Yes, sufferings after death.&nbsp;
What is history but the story of punishment?&nbsp; When men scoff
at what is called eternal punishment they forget, or, perhaps,
have never given it a thought, that the punishment of the first
crime is going on at the present moment.&nbsp; Thorns and briars
are but parables.&nbsp; They are real, it is true.&nbsp; Man must
wrestle with his mother earth for every bit he eats.&nbsp; She
does not feed him willingly; she produces that which he cannot
eat.&nbsp; He must lacerate her bosom with his spade ere she will
yield him bread, and he must sweat with toil before she will give
him his crust!</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Yet this is but the shadow of something terribly
worse.&nbsp; The non-producer will live, whatever becomes of
those who toil.&nbsp; What is war but one of the many things
which rob man of his bread?&nbsp; The soldier is a consumer, not
a producer.&nbsp; I do not say he is not a necessity.&nbsp; He is
all that, but he must be fed.&nbsp; What matters it to him what
is the price of meat; he will have his three-quarters of a pound
of meat every day.&nbsp; Aye, and he earns it too!&nbsp; Who
would grudge the brave fellows in Egypt the stores we send
out?&nbsp; None of us.&nbsp; Yet we cannot but feel that the
sword and bayonet, like the thorn hedge, take up soil which might
grow corn, and the higher it grows the greater the shadow, and
therefore the poorer the crops which are nighest to it.&nbsp; It
is a necessity, but it is an expense.</p>
<p>What are the so called dangerous classes?&nbsp; They live,
they do not starve; they live on honest people.&nbsp; Judges,
police, and jailers are fed by those who never trouble
them.&nbsp; Crime is like a leech on the body, it will have
blood.&nbsp; The wrongdoers are not the thorn hedge which we need
for our protection, but the thistle, which has rare powers of
reproduction, and uses the wind as its chariot to ride to other
lands.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that wickedness is so difficult to
eradicate?&nbsp; Those of us who have tried to keep our gardens
free have sorrowed many a time when we have thought that the
rain, so welcome to our newly-born flowers, will call into vigour
the enemy that tries to strangle them.&nbsp; And this is but a
figure of the terrible truth that prosperity to a nation always
means a growth of crime, and that any event, even a public
holiday, which should refresh and recuperate, means the
resurrection of violence and an increase of suffering.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The first lie dug the first grave, and has never
ceased to dig others.&nbsp; We have often imagined the scene when
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Abel was missed&mdash;when his mother questioned his
murderer as to where he had last seen his brother.&nbsp; How they
would listen for his step, until suspense could be no longer
borne, and the father would go out, only to find the corpse of
his beloved child!&nbsp; Can we not hear the mother cry out, as
she touches the cold clay&mdash;&ldquo;Would to God I had died
the day I believed the lie!&rdquo;&nbsp; What a picture for a
painter like Rembrandt would that first funeral be!&nbsp; And
what are churchyards and cemeteries but the proofs that the devil
lied?&nbsp; Have you a grave?&nbsp; Does the clay cover the form
once dearer than life to you?&nbsp; Let it plead with you to
believe God and his word, rather than to trust to the old
serpent.</p>
<p>Let us be thankful that the seed of the woman is the Saviour
of Men.&nbsp; Eden is not all shadow, even after the loss of
purity.&nbsp; There is a promise yet to be fulfilled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,&rsquo; saith the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; The devil is to be cast into the bottomless
pit, and even those whom he has deceived may go to a paradise
where the trail of the serpent shall be no more seen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the
works of the devil,&rdquo; and the time is coming when war,
slavery, ignorance, tyranny, hunger, and sin shall be among the
dark clouds that roll away, as the sun which shall never set
rises above the horizon to make glad the children of men.&nbsp;
Then shall the prophecy of the poet become history&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Him the tribes of Adam boast<br />
More blessings than their father lost.&rdquo;</p>

GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE.<br />
<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> vi.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Not seen by everyone
there</span>.&mdash;Isaiah had his eyes opened.&nbsp; The same
awful Person had been present before, but had not been seen, and
He is still there, but how few of us are conscious of His
presence.&nbsp; How differently the church and chapel-goers would
look next Sunday morning as they come home, if only they realised
what had been going on in the place where they had spent the last
hour.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">A Lesson from
History</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;In the year that King Uzziah died I
saw the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; The King of Judah was dead, but the
King of Saints lives for ever.&nbsp; Whatever changes go on,
whatever crown shifts to another head, <span
class="smcap">God</span> remains the same.&nbsp; In no battle is
our General slain.&nbsp; In no national disgrace is He
humbled.&nbsp; Uzziah had died a leper, his brilliant history
ended in disgrace.&nbsp; Not so with Him whom we delight to
honour.&nbsp; Of Him it is more true than of anyone else,
&ldquo;The path of <span class="smcap">The Just</span> shineth
more and more unto the perfect day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">A Lesson in
Worship</span>.&mdash;We see how the angels behave when in
God&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Covered his face.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Contrast this with the way the average church-goer acts.&nbsp; To
look at the listless faces, the slovenly way in which men and
women pray, the want of reverence, often in choirs, and sometimes
in pulpits, makes us think there must be either a want of
intellect or a lack of faith.&nbsp; If these people believe there
is <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>a God, how limited their power to conceive what He is
like!&nbsp; But, knowing many of them to be shrewd in business or
personal matters, we are led to think there is often more
infidelity in places of worship than is thought for.&nbsp; The
conduct of the Seraphims makes us blush for many services we have
attended.&nbsp; If the thoughts of our hearts were spoken during
our prayers, what a revelation there would be!&nbsp; Let us not
forget that they are taken down, and are already in print, ready
for the day of trial, when the books shall be opened!</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">A Lesson in
Morals</span>.&mdash;Words defile us!&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a man of
unclean lips.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is a question if even swearing
defiles a man&rsquo;s mouth more than words of prayer which are
not meant.&nbsp; Would not any one of us rather be abused than
cajoled?&nbsp; Who likes to think that men are lying when they
praise us?&nbsp; Must we not pray for a watch to be set on our
lips?&nbsp; If there could be a physical effect caused, as there
is a moral, would not there be a sad disfigurement?&nbsp; Men and
women with lips blacker than coal!&nbsp; It is a wise prayer,
&ldquo;Let the words of my mouth be acceptable in Thy sight, O
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Deceit, flattery, formalism in prayer are
abominable to God.&nbsp; It would be well if, when in church or
chapel, we could see it in plain letters, &ldquo;The Lord will
not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Lesson in
Grace</span>.&mdash;Sin may be forgiven and guilt removed, and
this to the certain knowledge of the penitent.&nbsp; One of the
devil&rsquo;s lies is that either you are too wicked to be saved,
or, if saved, you cannot hope to know it in this life; the one
drives men to despair, the other prevents enjoyment of
salvation.&nbsp; Isaiah knew that his sins were forgiven, and we
have yet to learn that the cross of Jesus <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>has made it
less possible for us.&nbsp; It was from the altar the coal came
that touched the lips.&nbsp; It is still true that it is
sacrifice that takes away guilt.&nbsp; We have an altar, a
sacrifice, a benediction such as Isaiah never knew for himself;
we understand his sayings as he could not.&nbsp; &ldquo;By His
stripes we are healed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reader, do you long for
pardon, for conscious forgiveness?&nbsp; Wait on the Lord!&nbsp;
Think of what He suffered, and why He suffered, and you shall
sing with joyous lips&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pardon I
claim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a sinner I am,<br />
A sinner believing in Jesu&rsquo;s name.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He purchased the grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which now I embrace;<br />
O Father, thou knowest He hath died in my place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Lesson in
Theology</span>.&mdash;&ldquo;I heard the voice of the Lord,
saying, &lsquo;Whom shall I send?&nbsp; Who will go for
us?&rsquo;&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; Is it bad grammar or
good theology?&nbsp; It sounds like &ldquo;And God said, Let Us
make man in our image?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Lord God said,
Behold the man is become as one of Us.&rdquo;&nbsp; In John xii,
40, 41, we find that the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, was the
Lord who spoke the words we read in verses 9 and 10.&nbsp; In
Acts xxviii. 25 we are told it was the Holy Ghost who spake by
Isaiah.&nbsp; What does this mean but that the Divine Three in
One and One in Three was the Lord whom the prophet saw?</p>
<p>VI.&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Lesson to
Workers</span>.&mdash;When iniquity is purged away there is a
willingness to be sent on God&rsquo;s errands.&nbsp; The lips
that had been touched said, &ldquo;Here am I, send
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we are not willing to go, it is because there
is still need of cleansing.&nbsp; Let those of us who find <!--
page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>our feet slow to move on God&rsquo;s errands come again
to the place of burning.&nbsp; We shall do well to say with
Charles Wesley, in one of his less known poems&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ah! woe is me, immerst in sin,<br />
A man of lips and life unclean!<br />
How shall I with Thy message run,<br />
Or preach the pardoning God unknown?<br />
Unless my God vouchsafe to cheer<br />
His guilty, trembling messenger,<br />
My fears disperse, my sins remove,<br />
And purge me by the fire of love!</p>
<p>O wouldst Thou teach my lips once more,<br />
The comfort of Thy grace restore;<br />
Assure me, Lord, that mine Thou art,<br />
And stamp forgiveness on my heart;<br />
Then should I, in my Jesu&rsquo;s name,<br />
Glad tidings of great joy proclaim:<br />
Of grace, which every soul may find,<br />
And glory, bought for all mankind.</p>

<span class="smcap">paul</span>, <span class="smcap">thou must be

lo</span>, <span class="smcap">God hath given thee all them that

<p>What a ring there is in the words, &ldquo;Whose I am, and whom
I serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; How Paul delighted in the fact that he was
the servant of God.&nbsp; Often he used to say, &ldquo;Paul, a
servant of God,&rdquo; or rather &ldquo;Slave of God,&rdquo; for
that is what it means.&nbsp; And is it not still true that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Service is the
badge of Sonship</span>?</p>
<p>A man has no right to call himself a child of God who does not
work for Him.&nbsp; Was it not so with Christ himself?&nbsp; Did
He not, even when a boy, say, &ldquo;Wist ye not that I must be
about My Father&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; and the work of God is
the delight of the heir of God.&nbsp; We do not join the church
merely for what we can get, but for what we can do.&nbsp; How is
it with you?&nbsp; Do you say, &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>That&rsquo;s the way Paul began&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, what
wilt Thou have me to do?&rdquo;&nbsp; Too many of us
think&mdash;How can I enjoy myself?&nbsp; What can I do to
increase my happiness?&nbsp; If we would prove that we are the
legitimate children of God, we must find out the best way of
carrying out the wishes of God.&nbsp; If we set Christ before us
as our example&mdash;and after all He was the best servant His
Father ever had, for while He was in this world He went about
doing good, and we could have tracked His footsteps by the
cessation of suffering, and the increase of comfort&mdash;let us
set about the same work.&nbsp; It is our business, if we would
live godly, to dry up tears, and make smiles take the place of
groans.&nbsp; If you are not at this glorious employment, begin
to doubt if after all you are one of the elect.&nbsp; There are
numbers of low-spirited Christians who would soon be among those
who dance for joy if only they would look out for the one nearest
to them who is sad, and who requires sympathy and help.</p>
<p>What should you think of a man who wore the Queen&rsquo;s
uniform, and yet who fought in the rank of her enemies; or if he
did not fight against his own countrymen, assisted the foe to get
provisions and ammunition?&nbsp; But this is the position of some
who call themselves Christians.&nbsp; If they do not oppose
Christianity in person, they help on the other side, and by the
way they spend their money, and occupy their time, put all their
influence in the wrong scale.&nbsp; Depend upon it when wages are
paid, we shall find that each Master will claim those who served
him.&nbsp; We know where Paul will be that day.&nbsp; Let us be
in the same crowd!</p>
<p>While all this is true, we must not forget that</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Service beings
Storms</span>.</p>
<p>If Paul had been the kind of Christian some of us are, he
would have had a much easier time of it.&nbsp; However, that <!--
page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>was not what he looked for.&nbsp; He did not want his
heaven in this world, and so he had a rough time.&nbsp; Depend on
it we are not going to have too much heaven down here, if we are
to be crowned with immortality some day.&nbsp; There were in
Paul&rsquo;s day not a few who escaped peril by being polite to
the devil and all his crew, but that is something you and I
cannot afford to do.&nbsp; John Wesley might have become a
&ldquo;College Don,&rdquo; and have flourished at Oxford, and
perhaps if he had been strong enough of body, become an authority
as to the quality of port wine.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; There was
a suit of purple and fine linen for him, if he would have worn
it, instead of the rusty black cassock he was obliged to
wear.&nbsp; But, then, he chose affliction with the people of
God, and won by hard work a place among the four-and twenty
elders who sit nearest to the Lamb.</p>
<p>And it holds true yet that if we will only be quiet and give
Satan a bit of peace he will let us alone.&nbsp; Why could not
Paul have been still, he would have kept out of that doomed ship;
and so with thee my brother, thou mayest have a quiet life if
thou wilt only pray less and be content to allow sin to have its
own way.&nbsp; What are you most like?&nbsp; A barge or a
brig?&nbsp; For there are some Christians whose course through
life is like a canal-boat&rsquo;s path, smooth and level, with
nothing more exciting than a lock, while others have to put out
to sea and run the risk of tempest and wreck.&nbsp; Yet who does
not feel that there is a nobility about a sailor which a bargeman
cannot claim?&nbsp; Besides there&rsquo;s no room for promotion
aboard a &ldquo;flat,&rdquo; no more than there is the likelihood
of a storm.</p>
<p>As we read this story we feel that Paul was the true
master-mariner that day.&nbsp; His angelic visitor lifted him to
command, and this leads us to say,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Storms
cannot separate us from heaven</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;The angel stood by me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made no
mistake, he flew to the side of the real Commander, and it is
sweet to know that come what will, nothing can come between us
and the God we serve.</p>
<p>What a different man Moses was when he stood by the Red Sea,
to what he was when he was before the burning bush.&nbsp; Here
are the sheep patiently and quietly browsing, there is the angry
mob crying out &ldquo;Were there no graves in Egypt?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here there is the sign of God from whence comes the voice,
&ldquo;I have surely seen the affliction of My people,&rdquo; but
yonder is the pillar of cloud shewing the way over the waves of
the yet undivided sea.&nbsp; How much more noble is the Moses of
the people than the Moses of the sheep!&nbsp; It is true that he
had to encounter the storm, but then there was the triumph
waiting to succeed the tempest.&nbsp; He who fears the contest
should not covet the crown, but let the man who means to wear the
conqueror&rsquo;s diadem know that in the fiercest part of the
struggle the Lord Himself shall cheer His man!&nbsp; Besides,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Storms cannot
alter the Programme</span>.</p>
<p>God meant Paul to appear before C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; He was a
notable illustration of the saying of Solomon, &ldquo;Seest thou
a man diligent in his business, he shall stand before
kings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul, the slave of God, made judges tremble,
and his chained hands ruffled the imperial purple.&nbsp; If only
we sail with Jesus, storms become our slaves.&nbsp; The Lord
meant to have Christianity planted at Malta, and therefore
Euroclydon must drive the wreck to that shore, but still <i>en
route</i> to Rome.&nbsp; Take the so-called misfortunes out of
the history of religion, and you put it back into
commonplace.&nbsp; Persecution has pushed on the cause it has
striven <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>to hinder, and heroes are made by
hindrances.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do the heathen rage?&nbsp; The Lord
shall have them in derision.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was never so true
as it was when the time came for Jesus to die.&nbsp; It seems as
though Satan would have made a good Socinian.&nbsp; He saw not in
the Scripture either the Saviour&rsquo;s Divinity or His atoning
work, and so he hastened to have Him slain, and thereby carried
out the programme of God.&nbsp; Have you ever noticed the prayer
that was offered when the servants of God returned from
jail?&nbsp; (See Acts iv. 26 28).&nbsp; The enemy &ldquo;gathered
together to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined
before to be done!&rdquo;&nbsp; It shall yet be seen that no one
has done so much for the truth as he who was a liar from the
beginning!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">It pays to ride
with Jesus Christ&rsquo;s men</span>.</p>
<p>The angel brought the message, and Paul soon gave it out to
all abroad: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God hath given thee all
them that sail with thee</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is yet true that
religion is a great enemy to waste of life.&nbsp; Give us men who
serve Christ to be our servants, and we need less police and a
smaller fire brigade.&nbsp; Let Christ be King, and hospitals
will not be needed as they are now.&nbsp; If Jesus is Lord, the
alms-house would take the place of the Union.&nbsp; There is less
peril where there is piety.&nbsp; Every man aboard the ship was
to be saved, because Paul was there.&nbsp; Danger waits on the
disobedient, but Providence yet says to the good, all shall come
safe to land who sail with Paul.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
